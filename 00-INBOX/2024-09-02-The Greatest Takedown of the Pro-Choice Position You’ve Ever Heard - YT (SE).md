**Sermon Summary**:
The sermon delves into the concept of human value and function, particularly in the context of debates surrounding abortion. It highlights how some individuals, akin to racists of the past, attempt to separate human value from personhood based on arbitrary criteria. The speaker argues that such distinctions are used to justify mistreatment and discrimination against certain groups, including the unborn. By challenging the notion that specific functions or abilities determine personhood, the sermon advocates for grounding rights in the inherent human nature shared by all individuals.

**Key Points**:
- Human value is often confused with human function, leading to the devaluation of certain groups.

- Pro-lifers challenge the notion that specific functions like self-awareness or viability determine personhood.
- Grounding rights in functions that vary in degrees undermines human equality and dehumanizes individuals.
