SUMMARY:
The speaker discusses how devaluing human life based on functions rather than inherent worth dehumanizes individuals, particularly the unborn.

IDEAS:

- Pro-lifers argue against devaluing life based on functions like consciousness or desires.
- The possession of certain functions should not determine a person's right to life.
- Grounding rights in functions that vary in degrees leads to inequality in rights among individuals.
