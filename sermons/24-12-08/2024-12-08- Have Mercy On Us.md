# Have Mercy On Us

Well, good morning again. You can turn with me this morning to Isaiah chapter 9. The Church, throughout history, has made it part of her annual tradition to reflect on the prophecies surrounding the coming of Christ, the event of the birth itself, and even anticipating Christ's return. At this time of year, it's a season known as Advent—four weeks of reflection—and this is our second Sunday together in this Advent season.

Last Sunday, we looked at the story of Jesus' healing of the two blind men, and their cry was, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David." And that's going to be the springboard for a couple of reflections this month. Today, we're going to look at that cry, "Have mercy on us." Why do we need mercy, God's mercy? Next week, we're going to look at Jesus as the Son of David, and then we'll consider the birth of Christ. But today, we're going to look at our need for mercy by considering a text that's fairly often quoted around this time of year, particularly in churches. You'll hear it.

Isaiah 9, verses 1 through 5: Hear the word of the Lord.  

> "But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time, he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy. They rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian. For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult, and every garment rolled in blood, will be burned as fuel for the fire."

This is the word of the Lord.  

Why do we need God's mercy? That's the question. The answer of the Bible, and in the text this morning, is that we are in the dark—the darkness. We are like the blind men that Jesus had to heal. We're in the darkness.  

The darkness is described here. It's experientially described as gloom, anguish, and being greatly distressed. And there's no escaping it. They're walking in darkness, dwelling in a land of deep darkness. They're living there. They're walking there.  

I remember when my son and I went to this place called Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. We wanted to do something a little more adventurous, so we signed up to do actual cave spelunking. They gave us one of those hard hats with the little light on the front. Then you get down and crawl through these caves, and it's really dark—if it weren't for the light.  

The person guiding us said, "Do you notice where we are?" Everybody just stared at him, like, "No, we've just been going forever." He said, "We've gone in a circle." One of the things you just have no sense of in the dark, in a place you're unfamiliar with, is where you are. You're just spinning your wheels, going around and around.  

That's the way the Bible describes darkness for us—walking in circles, never getting out. Wherever you live, wherever you go, it's just darkness. Always darkness.  

The darkness is personal and spiritual in nature, as described here. It says, "The people who walked in darkness." There's people.  

Now, why were they in darkness? What put them in this state, according to the Bible?  

Well, if you read Isaiah before this point and the previous chapter, we see a couple of things. In Isaiah's day, there had developed widespread idolatry—worship of false gods, other gods. This was present among the people of God in Israel. There was widespread idolatry. The kings were wicked and did not worship the Lord.  

As part of that, they would do things like what we might compare to palm reading, horoscopes, seances, and such. They would call upon the dead and inquire of the dead: "What should we do?" They tried to find their way forward in the dark by inquiring of the dead rather than the living God. They didn't speak according to what Isaiah calls the "teaching and testimony" of God's word—the Scriptures. They had no interest in the teaching and testimony of the living God.  

Instead, they followed after false gods, inquired of the dead, and went their own way, living in the dark. They had no interest in God's word. Their teachings were dark and kept them blind to reality.  

Without the light of God's word or His presence, they stumbled around, the Bible says, like blind men. Those who made the idols became just like the idols—nothing, worthless, dark.  

The image Isaiah paints of them is one of turning their faces upward, angry at God because things were bad, and at the same time downward in gloom. Angry at God and sad in themselves, not knowing what they were supposed to do. There was nothing except distress and darkness.  

The Lord had judged the nation in their idolatry and thrust them into deep darkness. All of this was personal, felt, and experienced. It was spiritual.  

It is the people who are walking in darkness—spiritually blind, far from the living God.  

I would suggest that man still lives primarily that way. In the world in which we live, the word of God is not lifted up as the teaching and testimony. The one thing you need to pay attention to more than anything else is God's living word. That's not the general gist of the public perception of the word of God.  

Most believe God's word is just another book to be analyzed, judged, mocked, or treated with agnostic apathy or outright antagonism. But it's not God's word.  

Even in the churches, the plain gospel is often not preached. Leaders strive to make the Scripture more palatable to the current culture, more relevant, and so on. The word of God is winnowed down to "tips for a better way to live your life from a God who loves you just the way you are."  

The great gospel—the glorious gospel teaching and testimony that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, that man must repent of his sin and come to Christ Jesus to escape the wrath of God against sin, that God has made a way—all of that is set aside in so many places.  

The light is hidden away, and people are taught, "Here are ten tips for a better whatever."  

With that rejection of the gospel and refusal to teach it comes a flood of substitutes and idols in people's lives. Everyone knows they need something.  

Certainly! Picking up where we left off:

---

And so, there's this incredible inward need that's just filled up with distractions forever—idols for us to worship. Idols like body image, family, work, money, or some god we create in our own imagination. Anything that we stick in the place of God as a way of giving us some value and meaning in life. But those idols just drive us further into personal, spiritual darkness—a life without God, a life without Christ.  

The darkness of this world is so personal, so spiritual, for each person. And because the world is so full of darkness, it begins to show itself culturally and nationally.  

In Isaiah's day, there was a great nation, Assyria, that was a tremendous threat. It had ravaged the northern kingdom, was threatening the southern kingdom, and had taken over much, including the areas referenced here—Zebulun and Naphtali. The foreign powers had taken over.  

The Assyrians would resettle these places, pulling out the people who lived there and adding in others to keep everybody confused because they didn’t speak the same language. Over time, they mixed together.  

This led to the contempt talked about here for those lands because they weren’t "pure Jewish lands." The area became Galilee, Galilee of the nations—Gentiles. That’s why, in the Bible, there’s often disdain for Jesus because of where He’s from. People say things like, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” or, “No prophet would arise out of Galilee.” This was considered the lowest section of the country, worthless.  

The world they lived in—the land of Israel—was decimated by war. It’s something we don’t experience here in our country, but in their time, it was absolute devastation. There was a refugee crisis of their day, tremendous anger, and people looking for someone to blame. Because that’s what we do when we’re angry—we look for someone to blame.  

They were greatly distressed, hungry. The Bible says they felt “the yoke of his burden, the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.” This language is similar to the taskmasters of Egypt. It was as bad as when they were slaves.  

This is what Isaiah is proclaiming—a dark time. And of course, it continues in our own day.  

There is conflict everywhere. There are wars and rumors of wars, refugee crises throughout the world. Closer to home, there’s brokenness and violence in our homes and communities. There’s depression, anxiety, mental disorders, emotional instability, sexual sin of all kinds, wandering in the dark, and economic turmoil.  

Things like identity theft amaze me. People want to take others' things. The Bible describes this darkness perfectly.  

I read on the internet—and if you can’t believe what you read there, what can you believe?—that $13.4 billion worth of packages were stolen from people’s front doors last year. Prosperity and democracy have not brought light into man’s heart. We operate the same way regardless.  

We forget and look for someone to blame for our distress. Oh, just like in Isaiah’s day, who do we blame? We blame God. We blame our leaders. We’re in the dark.  

We forget that it’s our own sin that brings judgment—that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. It’s not someone else’s fault that the world is the way it is. We’ve all played our part.  

Here we are, the people dwelling in darkness—sinners without hope. No amount of technological progress or material prosperity can change this reality for anyone. These things do not bring light, and they’re often the very tools that thrust us further into darkness.  

The people who walked in darkness, those who dwell in a land of deep darkness—the Bible says this is us. Darkness then, darkness now, stumbling around without God, without hope, in desperate need of God’s mercy.  

Why do we need mercy? Darkness. It’s the fallen world. Life is difficult.  

Out of His pity and compassion, God’s mercy for those dwelling in darkness shines. The Bible says, “Light shines.” Mercy has come. The light is shining, and with that light comes hope, growth, joy, and freedom.  

Most of us know the experience of being quite sick. You’ve eaten something that disagrees with you, and you know it’s going to be a rough night. You lie down, and immediately, you start coughing or feeling miserable. It’s understandable—you’re sick, you won’t sleep. Darkness sets in, and you’re miserable.  

But at some point during the night, you notice it’s getting a little lighter gray outside. What is that? You’re still in the same state, but somehow, when you start to see that the night is ending, that dawn is coming, it gives you hope. It’s not forever. You’re glad.  

The miserable night is over. The light has come.  

Friends, the Gospel’s declaration is that the darkness we’re in due to our own sin is not the end of the story. God, out of His love for us, sent His Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to bear our sins on the cross and give life to all who believe in His name, repent of their sins, and follow Him. He brings light into the world. He brings the new day.  

Are you a part of that new day? Have you come to Christ? You can do that today. You don’t need to be blind and in the darkness anymore. Come to Christ.  

As Christians, are we living as people of the day? Are we fighting against the world, the flesh, and the devil? This is a glorious day we’re part of—a day of hope, growth, joy, and freedom in Christ.  

Certainly! Continuing where we left off:

---

First, it is a day of **hope.** It says here, “But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish.” No gloom. In the latter time, He has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.  

Isaiah is saying this Assyrian business—it’s going to be over. It’s not going to be forever. There’s going to come a time where there’s no gloom. There’s going to come a time of hope because the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.  

This passage is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew at the beginning of the ministry of Jesus. Why? Because Jesus began His ministry right here, in these places. The Lord came to and from this slighted place, this place of contempt, and that’s where He chose to start His ministry—because that’s what He’s like.  

He brought light. He brought the light of the Gospel. Jesus begins His ministry and says, “Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand.” He brings Himself—the light of Jesus Himself. He says, “I am the light of the world. Are you living in darkness? Come to Me. I am the light of the world,” Jesus says.  

Into a world of oppression, injustice, and pride—a world of Roman occupation—Jesus came preaching a kingdom and a King that would outlast Caesar, that would outlast all worldly rulers, a kingdom that would rule forever according to the will and purposes of God.  

Christ came to proclaim Himself as King and His kingdom, which is the greatest kingdom.  

Into a world of Galilean contempt and Samaritan hatred, Jesus brought the good news of the inclusion of the Gentiles—of all people.  

Into a world of idolatry and worship of false trash, God Himself became man and shed light on who God really is. Jesus lived the perfect life of obedience, sacrifice, humiliation, and then exaltation. He showed the way of the teaching and testimony.  

He showed us what God’s word looked like in the flesh, what we are to be like. No longer would there be any need to wonder what God wanted from us. Jesus demonstrated it. He showed us by His life what we are to be like.  

Into a world of spiritual blindness, Jesus brought sight. He reconciles all who repent and turn to Him in faith to God.  

On the cross, the darkness—the utter despair of the wrath of God that we deserve for our sin—fell on Jesus. He became dark so that we wouldn’t remain in the dark. He became dark so that we could see, that we would have the light of forgiveness and eternal life.  

Christ establishes His kingdom—the kingdom of light. A kingdom built on the foundations of righteousness, justice, humility, compassion, kindness, love, and faithfulness.  

The light of Christ has shone—His death, His resurrection, His ascension, His exaltation, the pouring out of the Spirit, the spread of the Gospel.  

Yet darkness continues to exist in this world.  

So the Bible says we look forward to the promised return of Christ when the light will fully and finally drive out the darkness. We’ll see it. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel.  

It’s inevitable that history is moving in this direction. History now is walking toward Christ’s return—of that final time when the light of Christ will shine and all darkness will be dispelled forever.  

What He’s done in each individual heart who cries out to Him, He will do for the entire universe—all of creation. A new heavens and a new earth.  

The light brings this day of **hope.**  

It’s also a day of **growth.**  

If you want something to grow—plants, for example—you need light. Plants don’t grow in darkness. But if you give them the right amount of light, water, and nutrients, they grow.  

It says here, “The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them the light has shone.” And when the light shines, what Isaiah says here happens: “You have multiplied the nation.”  

The light of God’s word and promise multiplies the nation.  

God gave a promise to Abraham, saying He would take Abraham’s one child and from that child create a nation as numerous as the sand on the seashore—more than the stars in the heavens.  

And when Solomon becomes king many years later, the Bible says that Judah and Israel were as many as the sand on the seashore. They ate, they drank, and they were happy.  

This was a picture of the multiplying work of Christ.  

That’s what we see in the Bible—Christ, through the Spirit, growing the nation, growing His church.  

In Acts, for example:  

- “The Lord was adding to their number day by day.”  
- “The number of disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem.”  
- “Walking in the fear of the Lord and the comfort of the Holy Spirit, the church multiplied.”  
- “The word of God increased and multiplied.”  

The church continues to grow because Christ continues to shine His light.  

How does the church grow? Through the sufferings of Christ.  

“For it was fitting that He, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.”  

The suffering and death of Jesus—the Light of the World—was necessary so that the nation might be multiplied, so that the church might grow. Christ had to suffer, to pay the penalty for you and for me, so that we might sit here today in this crowded room.  

Next time you come in late and realize there are no seats, I want you to be thankful—thankful for the life and death of Jesus who brought you into a place where there were no seats.  

His work is to grow His people, to grow His church. He does that through the preaching of the Gospel.  

The message of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection—the simple call to repent and believe in Him—that light shines into people’s hearts, and they come to Christ.  

So, it’s a day of **hope,** a day of **growth,** and a day of **joy.**  

Certainly! Continuing from where we left off:

---

It’s a day of **joy.**  

Here it says, “You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy.”  

Can you imagine being under a foreign oppressor and then having that oppression lifted? The Bible gives us a picture of this when the Israelites escaped through the Red Sea. When the Egyptian armies were destroyed, they didn’t look back and feel sorry for the Egyptians—they celebrated! Their whole lives had changed because the oppressor was gone.  

Now they were free, and they expressed joy. They sang songs of what God had done for them.  

What did the angel say when the light of Christ came and brought joy? “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy.” Not a little joy—**great joy.**  

What’s the joy? The joy is that you’re no longer in darkness. The light is shining into the world. Christ has come. Salvation has come. Eternal life, hope, joy, freedom—everything worth anything has come in Christ. And so it makes people happy.  

Christ’s presence, the light of the world, brings joy.  

Think of His first miracle. If you and I could perform miracles, our first one probably wouldn’t be turning water into wine at a wedding feast. But that’s exactly what Jesus did. Why?  

Because He was going to a place of great joy, and He was showing, “This is who I am. I saved the best for last. The time has come.” He had come to bring joy to the world.  

I wonder what we bring to our holiday feasts. Do we bring the joy of Christ—the laughter and kindness that comes with it—or something else?  

When Philip proclaimed the Gospel in Samaria, the Scripture says, “There was much joy in that city.”  

Isaiah says, “As with joy at the harvest.” It’s a celebration of fruitfulness. And, “as they are glad when they divide the spoil.” That’s the joy of victory.  

There’s joy among God’s people—joy when we see fruitfulness, joy when we experience victories in suffering, joy when we see the church grow, joy when the Lord works in our hearts and changes us, joy when the testing of our faith yields endurance and strength.  

There’s so much joy in being a Christian. The light shines, and joy abounds.  

Finally, the light brings a day of **freedom.**  

Isaiah says, “You have broken the yoke of his burden, the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as on the day of Midian.”  

This is a reference to Gideon, the judge of Israel, when 300 Israelites faced the Midianite army. This wasn’t a Hollywood production where the 300 Israelites were elite soldiers. This wasn’t about their strength or skill.  

God intentionally reduced Gideon’s army to 300 men to ensure that the victory would clearly be His doing, not theirs.  

The Lord said, “The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’”  

So He reduced their numbers again and again until only 300 remained. These weren’t extraordinary soldiers—they were just ordinary men. But that was the point.  

The victory was the Lord’s doing. Isaiah’s prophecy reminds us that freedom comes from God, not man. It’s the work of the light.  

“You have broken,” Isaiah says—not “we have broken.” The Lord has done it.  

The rod and staff of the oppressor are replaced with the rod and staff of the Good Shepherd, Jesus. Slavery to sin is replaced with freedom in Christ.  

Friends, if you are in Christ, you are no longer slaves—you are sons and daughters.  

And there’s a finality to it. Isaiah speaks of gathering all the garments and boots of war and burning them as fuel for the fire. The oppression ends, and peace comes.  

As the hymn writer says:  

> "For lo, the days are hastening on,  
> By prophet bards foretold,  
> When with the ever-circling years,  
> Comes round the age of gold;  
> When peace shall over all the earth  
> Its ancient splendors fling,  
> And the whole world give back the song  
> Which now the angels sing."  

The light of Christ will bring freedom forever.  

Jesus, the Light of the World, is bringing freedom and peace on earth through the proclamation of the Gospel and the power of the Holy Spirit. Darkness is coming to an end.  

“The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever.”  

“The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.”  

We were blind, but in Christ, we see.  

This Christmas, as you see all the lights, remember that Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, has brought hope into this world. He has multiplied the nation and built the Church. He has increased our joy and set us free from slavery to sin.  

And remember, His work is not yet done. He calls us, as Christians, to be the light of the world. We are blessed to play our part in the spread of the Gospel through prayer, worship, and the proclamation of the glorious Gospel of Jesus—in word and deed.  

Rejoice that Jesus will continue His work until the darkness is driven away once and for all.  

And just as in Solomon’s day, we will sit with our brothers and sisters from all nations around the table of our Lord. We will eat, drink, and be happy.  

Amen.
