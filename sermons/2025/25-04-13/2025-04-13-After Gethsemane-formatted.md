# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 13 APRIL 2025 "After Gethsemane"

If you have your Bibles with you this morning, you can turn to Matthew chapter 26. If you're visiting with us today, we're very glad to have you here. And we have been considering for quite some time now together the Gospel of Matthew. It's the story of Jesus, His words and His works. And we are now approaching the end of the book. We've arrived at the time just before Jesus' death. Jesus had been in Jerusalem with His disciples eating the Passover meal. After the meal, Jesus and His disciples head out towards the Mount of Olives and the garden of Gethsemane. And last week we considered what happened there. We looked at the great sorrow that Jesus was experiencing as He considered the final hours of His humiliation and suffering, which would culminate in His death on the cross. The sorrow of loneliness and rejection, and most of all, the sorrow of the cup of God's wrath that Jesus would take, would drink for our salvation. We considered also the well-intentioned but sleeping disciples. We had another look at the betrayal of Jesus and Jesus' own commitment to seeing everything through, that the scriptures might be fulfilled.

This Friday at 6:30, here we are going to be reading through the account of Jesus' final hours in Matthew 27 as He heads to the cross and then suffers and dies there. And so I'd invite you to come and participate in that this Friday. Today we're going to consider the first trial, not as in difficult things, but actual trial that Jesus faced. It's a religious trial. Jesus has now been arrested, and He's being taken before the chief priests and the elders in Jerusalem. Following at a distance from Him and the crowd, the mob that's taking Him there, is Peter. This is Peter, His best friend, who had slept in the garden instead of being watchful and praying, who had cut off the ear of one of the mob that had come to arrest Jesus, only to have Jesus tell him to put his sword away and then to heal the ear of the person who Peter had harmed. This is Peter, who fled from the garden with the rest of the disciples. This is Peter, the disciple whom Jesus had said would deny Him three times. And this is the same Peter who had suggested that Jesus did not know what He was talking about, that Peter would rather die than deny Him. And we find Peter following at a distance. The scripture says, as we read this morning, so that Peter could see the end.

It's here that we'll pick up, considering what Peter saw and then what Peter did and then what Peter wrote. And hear the word of the Lord this morning from Matthew 26, beginning in verse 57:

Then those who had seized Jesus led Him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. And Peter was following Him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside, he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus, that they might put Him to death. But they found none. Though many false witnesses came forward, at last, two came forward and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.'" And the high priest stood up and said, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?" But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God." And Jesus said to him, "You've said so, but I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven." And then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He's uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You've now heard His blasphemy. What is your judgment?" And they answered, "He deserves death." And then they spit in His face. And they struck Him. Some slapped Him, saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ, who is it that struck you?"Now, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean." But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean." And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him. And she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth." And again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man." And after a little while, the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you." Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man." And immediately the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out. He wept bitterly.

This is the word of the Lord.

This morning, Peter is watching from a distance, the Bible says, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. Then he came, and he sort of slipped in to watch the proceedings, sitting with the guards. The Bible says he's just in there in the back. And the question is, well, what did he see? He came to see the end. What did he see? Well, the first thing that he saw was the Sanhedrin, the council. Jesus looks, and he sees thatâ€”I mean, Peter looks, and he sees that Jesus has been led into this place where Caiaphas was, and gathered there is the council of the chief priests and the religious leaders in Jerusalem with Caiaphas overseeing the trial. There may be 50 men there. So it was a council of around that size. So these 50 men are gathered around Jesus, and Peter is watching it all.

Well, what would he have observed about this council? The first thing that he would have seen is that it was a very wicked council. They are determined, the Bible says, to put Jesus to death. It was a verdict that was waiting for a trial. They had already decided, pre-decided, exactly how this was going to go. They were going to put Jesus to death, the one who had never sinned. They were determined to condemn as a notorious sinner. This was this council, a wicked council, hateful towards Christ.

And then he would have seen, too, that it was a plotting council. The Bible teaches us here that they were seeking false witnesses. Why were they doing that? Well, if Jesus was going to be executed, He would need to be executed by the Roman officials. And the Roman officials weren't going to just execute anybody. There had to be a reason for the person to be executed. And so they were trying to drum up a reason that would be sufficient enough for the Roman officials to do the act of executing Jesus. So they sought false witnesses. Maybe they also wanted to feel like they were justified in doing what they were about to do. If we get enough people talking, or maybe not. Maybe they paid off people like they paid off Judas just to say false things. They were a plotting council.

And then Peter is sitting there listening. And so he knows that this is also a council of lies. He hears one false witness after another saying things about Jesus which he himself had witnessed would not have been true. There they are, one after another, coming. The council found those who walked in the way of sinners, as the Psalms would say. They were willing to lie. They're willing to lie for payment. They either hated Jesus or had some problem or just wanted money, but they were willing to bear false witness. They were willing to break the commandment of God, "You shall not bear false witness," in order to condemn the Son of God.

The problem was, and we hear, was that their stories weren't matching. They hadn't got them all together in a room beforehand. So one false witness would come up and another. But they needed two to agree. So the Bible tells us that at last, after a while, two men came forward with the same story. And this was the story. They looked at Jesus, and they said, "This man said, 'I'm able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'" That was their lie. This man said, "I am able to destroy the temple in three days and rebuild it." Or, "Destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days."

Now, Jesus had said something that sounded very similar. He had said this: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The scripture says that He was speaking about the temple of His own body, that they could destroy Him, but in three days, He would raise it up. He would be raised. Jesus had never threatened to destroy the temple Himself like these false witnesses were claiming. But it didn't matter. They now had two witnesses who were saying the exact same thing, that Jesus was threatening to destroy the temple. It was a council of lies.

And then it was also a council of the proud, because there was Caiaphas. He was the religious leader, the top religious leader, and he knew it. He was the high priest, and he challenges Jesus. He says, "Well, what are you going to say? Here are these two men, and they're saying this to you about you. Have you no answer to make? What is it these men are saying about you? Do you want to try to refute it?" And Jesus, the Bible says, remains silent. But the proud Caiaphas, he continues to press. "I want something out of you. I want a confession. I adjure you by the living God. Tell us. I mean, are you the Christ? Are you the Son of God or aren't you?" And when Jesus responds, Caiaphas, the proud, makes a show of it. He tears his robes. He charges Jesus with blasphemy. "It's so obvious. Look, this is a temple destroyer. And now He's even saying that He's going to be sitting at the right hand of God. What more do you need? He's a blasphemer," and he calls on the council to pass judgment. In a big surprise, they pass the judgment. They say, "Jesus deserves death."

And then we saw that this was the council of the brutal, because the Bible says that then, after making that proclamation, these men got around Jesus, and they spat in His face. I mean, can you think of an uglier action? I mean, it's not lying, right? People lie. It's not even getting in a fight with Him. People get in fights. They went up to the Son of God, and they spit in His face. That action is such a declaration of the worthlessness, a judgment of worthlessness. I mean, those men are saying to Jesus, in that action, "You are worth absolutely nothing." Then it says they struck Him, they slapped Him, they mocked Him like children. In another one of the gospels, it says that they blindfolded Him before this little game they played, hitting Him and then saying, "So who hit you? Prophesy, tell us." Peter, Jesus' best friend, watched it all.

What Peter saw, in addition to this wicked, plotting, lying, proud, brutal council, was he saw the Christ, his friend, Jesus, the Son of God, the king. And when Peter looked, what did he see about Jesus? It says that Jesus was silent. And then eventually He answers Caiaphas' question about whether Jesus is the Christ. He says, "Well, you've said so." It's as if Jesus is saying, "Well, that's what you're saying, and it's true. But you don't understand what you're talking about," because then He adds this phrase: "But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven." He's saying, "I tell you that the Christ is way greater than what you think, and that the Son of Man, the person that you're about to condemn, is going to be seated at the right hand of the power, the right hand of God, and that He's going to be coming again to judge. That's how you're going to know me from here on out, Caiaphas, as the one who's seated at the right hand of God, as the judge of all things and all men." Caiaphas has no idea who he's dealing with.

Peter saw all of this: Jesus remaining silent, then Jesus speaking of His sitting at the right hand of God and coming in power to judge. He's seen the wicked council condemning Him, beating Him, spitting in his best friend's face, mocking Him. Did Peter stand up for Him in this place? Would he draw the sword now like he did in the garden? What did Peter do?

Well, the scripture says first that Peter kept at a distance. He begins in the courtyard. As the situation intensifies, as you read, you see that he sort of moves further and further away. He moves outside the courtyard where he encounters the servant girls and then the bystanders. Peter keeps his distance from Jesus, which is a kind of nonverbal denial. His body language matched his ultimate actual words, didn't it? Moving further away from Christ, denying Him in that way. He's afraid. He doesn't want to get involved. Here stands Jesus, falsely accused, and he's heard all the false accusations. And Peter won't come to His defense. He won't speak up for his friend's character. He just came to see how it all ended. He doesn't want at this point in time to get involved. He's afraid. Maybe you've been in situations like that where, as a Christian, it's like, it's not easy to be a Christian. So you're joining a mammoth crowd that knows that it's not easy sometimes to be a Christian. What are you going to do when you're afraid, when it's going to cost you to say, "I belong to Jesus"?

So here is this: Peter keeps at a distance. And the second thing he does is Peter panicked under pressure. There's Jesus, silent, and then there's Peter, who's talking and cursing and getting louder and making all kinds of statements. And whereas the pressure Jesus was under came from the most powerful religious men of His day, the Bible is very clear that Peter felt the pressure from a couple of servant girls. He panicked.

And then Peter denied that he knew Jesus. First servant girl comes up and says to him that he was with Jesus. And Peter responds, chooses to respond, and he says, "I don't know, I don't know. I don't know what you mean. I don't know this man." And then another servant girl comes and says to the bystanders around Peter, right, sort of ups the ante a little bit, "Oh, this man definitely was with Jesus of Nazareth." And then Peter feels the pressure, right? And then he goes as far as making an oath, like he takes a more serious thing now. He's taking an oath. And we've read about what that means, like before God, he says, "I don't know you. I don't know the man. I don't know Jesus." And then finally, some of the bystanders who clearly had been talking, they heard Peter because he decided to talk, and they concluded that, "You know, he's from the south, his accent betrayed him. We can tell exactly where you're from. Stop, you know, stop pretending like that you weren't with Jesus because you clearly are a Galilean. You talk like a Galilean, you walk like him, you know, you are one." And now Peter gets even louder, and he places a curse on himself, and he swears, "I don't know him." And then the rooster crows.

The next thing the Bible says that Peter did was that he remembered. I think that's interesting. The rooster crows, and Peter remembered. He remembered the saying of Jesus, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And flashing before his mind, I would imagine that it's likely that he remembers a lot of things that sort of opens up the floodgates. He remembers the feeding of the 5,000. He remembers all of the healings. He remembers Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. He remembers Jesus calming the sea. He remembers that Jesus, when Peter was drowning, held out His hand and lifted Peter up and saved his life. He remembers Jesus including Peter in everything: how He affirmed him when he first said that Jesus was the Christ, how He took him with Him on the mount when He was transfigured in glory. And when he needed a poll tax, it was Jesus who paid the poll tax for him, with that pulling the money out of the fish for Peter's benefit. Everything marvelous, everything for Peter. Clearly Jesus loved him.

Maybe he remembered some of Jesus' teaching. Maybe he remembered this: "Everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father in heaven." Maybe he remembered that too, because the Bible teaches that in the next moment what happens is that he went out, and he wept bitterly. One can only imagine the reflection that this man had. "Who am I? What am I? I'm such a failure. What a fraud. All my loud-mouthed words, all my good intentions, all my bravado about how I was going to be such a wonderful friend, my Lord, and my friend is going to die. And I deny that I even knew Him, just to save my skin."

We have a picture of the lowest point in Peter's life. And some of you in this room, you actually know the feeling. The lowest point. The sin so destructive and so deep. The sin that you can't excuse away and blame on anybody else. Who's Peter going to blame anything on? Him. It's such a bitter pill to swallow, the recognition that you are responsible, that you are a sinner. "I'm a sinner. I'm the one who did it. I'm the one who denied. There's no excuses. There's nowhere for you to hide." And so inside, and sometimes it works its way out, you weep bitterly.

Peter came to see the end. Peter denied Jesus. And in the end, as far as Peter could tell, he had failed Jesus. An absolute tragedy. How could he live with himself? Except it wasn't the end. I remember I had a dream that when you woke up from the dream, you were like, "I am so glad that that was a dream." Like, it seemed so real when you were in it. And then all of a sudden, it's like you're awake, and you're like, "Okay, good, that wasn't real. I'm so thankful." Peter isn't dreaming. But he's soon able to rejoice that the trial and the cross, that what he's watching, is not the end. There's a big surprise. It's like waking up and realizing that reality is not what you thought reality was.

Something happened that changed his life. Something happened that swallowed up this great significant sin of denial and restored him to an even greater responsibility, being a leader in Jesus' Church. Jesus rose again, and He forgave and He restored Peter. And then Jesus poured out on Peter and the other disciples the Holy Spirit to strengthen and enable Peter to be a leader in the body of Christ. And in this role, Peter wrote two letters. Well, he probably wrote a lot of letters, but we have two of the letters. He wrote them several years after that terrible religious trial. This is the same man. And I wanted to share a few of Peter's thoughts from his first letter. Same man, but a new man.

At the beginning of the first letter, Peter addresses it like this. He says, "This is Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ." Not a failure. Not the one that used to be. Like, there's no denial. None at all. This is an embracing of Jesus Christ. "Peter, here's my name. Write it," you know, like the John Hancock dude did on our Constitution. "I'm writing it real big so they know," right? It's like that. He's like, "Here it is, Peter, an apostle." Then he goes on, and he begins to speak about the blood of Christ, his friend and his Savior. And26 And he says, this is in First Peter 1, because I want to tell you about the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. "Let me tell you about this precious, this precious Christ." And he goes on, he says, "You know, as you come to Him, when you come to Him as people, a living stone who is rejected by men." And whenever he would say that, I can't imagine that Peter wouldn't remember, "rejected by men, but in the sight of God chosen and precious."

And then there's this. Matt referenced it a little earlier. Peter writes this. He says, "Christ suffered for you." And he's, of course, including himself. He says, "Christ suffered for you so that you might follow in His steps." And then he recounts the trial. He says, "He committed no sin, and there was no deceit. There was no lying found in His mouth. And when He was reviled, when He was spat upon and punched and slapped, He didn't revile in return. And when He suffered, He didn't threaten, but He continued entrusting Himself to Him who judges justly."

Peter's seeing it all again. He says, "And I watched it. I watched Him do it. I watched all of this happen. And I'm telling you about it. Here it is. Even though He was getting slapped, He didn't just kill the dude. Even though someone was spitting on Him, He didn't just judge them on the spot. Instead, what He did was He just kept entrusting Himself to the Father the whole time. And then He bore our sins." And of course, Peter's thinking, "and my sin." "He bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin, that we might never deny Him again, and that we might live to righteousness. Because by His wounds you've been healed, for you were straying like sheep, but now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."

You can almost hear Peter saying, "I was straying, but I was returned by God's grace. And you can return too." He goes on, "Christ suffered. He always suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous." "I watched the righteous sufferer, and He did that for me. Why? That He might bring us to God, that we might really know God, that we might stop all the bluster and talk about God and, like, actually know Him. Christ suffered so that would be possible. He went to the cross so you and I could know God. Do you want to know God? There's only one way, is to know Christ. He suffered for you."

For that, he says, "Rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings." Peter would die for Jesus. He actually would die for Jesus. He says, "I rejoice in those sufferings now. Because when Christ's glory is going to be revealed, I'm going to share in that." And then he goes on, he says, "So I, exhorting all the elders among you as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that's going to be revealed. I saw it all," he said. "I witnessed the sufferings of Christ. I saw every single bit of it."

How did he get from what we read to what he wrote? Well, the Apostle John tells us Jesus, of course, didn't remain dead. He died on the cross, but He didn't remain dead. He rose again from the grave. And we're going to really celebrate that next week. But we're celebrating it now. We celebrate it all the time. He rose from the dead. But then there was Peter. Peter still had to be dealt with. There's sad Peter, maybe still afraid, but just sorrowful. And he's heard and he's seen that Jesus has risen from the dead, and he's reflecting on this. He must have been both excited about Jesus' resurrection and also just so sad. And, I mean, it would have been such a mix of emotions, right?

So what does he do? Well, he does what many men still do. He went fishing. He went fishing. If you're a woman and you like to fish, that's fine too. The point is that, like, he goes, and he went fishing. He's trying to figure it out. And then on the shore, Jesus comes, and the Bible tells us that everybody kind of rushes to shore, and Peter actually jumps in the water. And they're not sure whether that's out of terror or out of joy. They don't know. Maybe he's still confused. But they eventually, everybody gets to the shore, and Jesus has a conversation with Peter, and He goes up to Peter, His friend, who was so terribly sorrowful and grieved, and He does it to us still today, each one of us, and He asks the most important question that anyone can, that Jesus can ask you. He says, "Do you love me?" And Peter says, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." And so Jesus says, "Okay, feed my sheep." In other words, "Be a leader. Encourage and strengthen the brothers and sisters. Feed my sheep."

And then Jesus looks at him again, and He says, "Do you love me?" And Peter is like, "Yes, of course I love you." "Feed my sheep." And then a third time, "But do you love me?" And the Bible says that Peter was grieved because He said to him a third time, "Do you love me?" But this is how Peter responds. He says, "Lord, you know everything, and you know that I love you." And Jesus calls Peter to do the same thing.

There is a godly sorrow in Peter that leads to repentance, that tries to hide nothing, that says, "Lord, you know everything." And then makes his declaration of love and sorrow, of grief, that we fail to love as we ought. This godly sorrow that leads to repentance opens up a whole new world for a person, a world of responsibility: "Feed my sheep." As we're fully reconciled and accepted and loved by God, Jesus doesn't take your sin, forgive you of it, and then leave you in a nothing space. He forgives you of your sin, accepts you back, reconciles you to Himself, and then gives you a life to live. He gives you things to do. He gives you responsibilities to take care of. That's what the Lord does with that.

If you've reached your lowest point, or if your sins weigh heavily on you this morning, I want to encourage you that the Lord is there, and He's ready to forgive. We all ought to grieve our sins. That's the proper response to sin: not to hide it, not to pretend it doesn't exist, not to try to rationalize it away, to grieve our sins, and may we confess our sins that we might know Christ's forgiveness, real forgiveness. I mean, remember, who will forgive us? The one who will forgive you of your sins is the man that Peter watched that night: Jesus, the king who stood silent before His wicked accusers. He committed no sin. He never lied. When He was spat upon and beaten, He didn't fight back or threaten. He just kept entrusting Himself to the Father because He was going to drink the cup of God's wrath for us. He was determined to do so out of love for you.

This Jesus is your king, and He did all of this for you. He suffered and died to bear your sins on the cross, the righteous for the unrighteous, and by His wounds you are healed. So don't keep Him at a distance, and don't deny Him ever again. But come to Him. Repent of your sins, turn from them to Jesus, and receive eternal life and the abundant blessings of God: joy, hope, purpose, the forgiveness of sins now and forever. Amen.

Let's pray.
