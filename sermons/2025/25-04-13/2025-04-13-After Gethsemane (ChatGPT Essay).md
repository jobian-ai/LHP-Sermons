# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 13 APRIL 2025 "After Gethsemane"

## The Distance Between

When Peter followed Jesus at a distance, he probably thought it was the safest way to stay loyal. Not too close to be caught. Not too far to be indifferent. Just close enough to see what would happen. That’s the kind of distance most of us try to keep when something costly is happening to someone we love. You don’t want to be a coward, but you don’t want to lose everything either. And you hope, somehow, that watching from a distance still counts as being faithful.

But it doesn’t. And Peter found that out the hard way.

It’s one of the most honest stories in the Bible. Peter—loud, loyal, always first to speak—follows Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard and watches the trial unfold. He sees the whole thing. The lies. The setup. The spit. The slaps. The silence. Jesus doesn’t defend Himself, and Peter doesn’t defend Him either. He just watches. And when a servant girl says, “You were with Him,” Peter says what any of us might say if we were afraid. “I don’t know what you mean.”

And just like that, Peter becomes what he feared. Not a hero, but a traitor.

The strange thing is, none of it surprises Jesus. He said it would happen. That’s what finally hits Peter—after the rooster crows, after the curse, after he’s yelled for everyone to hear that he doesn’t even know the man. Then he remembers. Jesus had said all of this. And Peter had insisted, “I’ll never deny you.” But here he is. Not in a battle. Not in a courtroom. Just in a courtyard, lying to a couple of servant girls. And he breaks.

There’s something terrible about realizing you’ve done the very thing you swore you’d never do. But there’s also something clarifying. No more pretending. No more heroic speeches. Just bitter tears and a ruined idea of who you thought you were.

That’s where grace begins.

Because this wasn’t the end of Peter’s story. It wasn’t even close. If the story ended in that courtyard, it would just be a tragedy. But Jesus wasn’t finished with Peter. He didn’t cancel him or replace him. He rose from the dead, found Peter on a beach, and asked him one simple question: “Do you love me?”

Peter had denied Jesus three times. So Jesus asked three times. Not to rub it in, but to heal it. And every time Peter said yes, Jesus gave him something to do. “Feed my sheep.” That’s the part we miss. Forgiveness isn’t just about being let off the hook. It’s about being brought back into the mission. Jesus didn’t just forgive Peter. He re-enlisted him.

That’s what real repentance does. It doesn’t just feel bad. It leads somewhere. The same Peter who denied Jesus became the one who stood up in Jerusalem and preached that Jesus was Lord. The same man who couldn’t face a servant girl wrote letters that would strengthen the whole church.

The worst moment in Peter’s life became the doorway into a new one. That’s how grace works. It finds you in the courtyard and leads you to the cross. And then it leads you past the cross, to something even harder to believe: a second chance. A life not built on your promises to Jesus, but on His promises to you.

Peter wept bitterly. But he also walked again—this time not at a distance.

And that’s the point. The distance never saves you. It only delays the fall. But once you’ve fallen, and grieved it, and turned back, you realize that Jesus wasn’t asking for your perfection. Just your heart. Just your love.

And if you still love Him, even after everything, He’ll give you something to do.
