# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 13 APRIL 2025 "After Gethsemane"

## The Weight of Denial

I’ve been thinking about failure lately, not the small kind, but the kind that feels like it defines you. The kind where you betray someone you love, not because you meant to, but because fear got the better of you. There’s a story in the Bible, in Matthew 26, that gets at this better than anything I’ve read. It’s about Peter, Jesus’ closest friend, and the night he denied knowing him. It’s a story about human weakness, but also about something bigger: what happens after you fail.

Peter’s story starts in a courtyard. Jesus has just been arrested and dragged before a council of religious leaders determined to kill him. They’re throwing out false accusations, like claiming Jesus said he’d destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days. It’s a distortion of something he did say—about his own resurrection—but they don’t care. They want him dead. Peter’s there, watching from a distance, trying to stay close without getting caught. He’s already messed up once, falling asleep when Jesus needed him to pray, then slashing a guy’s ear off in a panic. Jesus healed the ear, told him to knock it off, but you can feel Peter’s desperation. He wants to be loyal. He said he’d die for Jesus. But now, things are real.

The council is brutal. They spit on Jesus, slap him, mock him. Peter sees it all. And then a servant girl spots him. “You were with Jesus,” she says. It’s not even a big accusation, but Peter freezes. “I don’t know what you mean,” he says. Another girl says it again, and he denies it harder, swearing an oath. Then some bystanders notice his Galilean accent—dead giveaway—and Peter loses it. He curses, screams, “I don’t know the man!” And right then, a rooster crows. Jesus had predicted this: “Before the rooster crows, you’ll deny me three times.” Peter remembers, and it breaks him. He runs out, weeping.

That moment is the lowest point of Peter’s life. He didn’t just fail; he betrayed the person who loved him most. He’d seen Jesus feed thousands, raise the dead, save his own life when he was sinking in a storm. And still, when it mattered, he choked. It’s tempting to judge him, but I’ve been there. Maybe not cursing in a courtyard, but dodging something true because it was easier. Fear makes you small. It’s not just Peter’s story; it’s ours.

What’s surprising, though, is what happens next. You’d think that’d be the end of Peter. He’s done, right? But it’s not. Jesus doesn’t stay dead. He rises, and when he meets Peter again, he doesn’t bring up the denial. Instead, he asks, “Do you love me?” Three times, matching the three denials. Peter’s grieved, but he says, “You know I love you.” And Jesus doesn’t reject him. He says, “Feed my sheep.” He gives Peter a job, a purpose. Later, Peter becomes a leader, writing letters that echo what he saw: Jesus suffered, sinless, to bear our sins, so we could know God. Peter’s failure didn’t define him. It was a step toward something bigger.

This gets me thinking about failure in general. We’re so afraid of it, we avoid risks that might expose us. But failure isn’t the end unless you let it be. Peter’s denial was awful, but it taught him something he couldn’t learn any other way: you can’t rely on your own strength. He had to face his weakness, grieve it, and then let Jesus rebuild him. That’s the pattern. You mess up, you own it, and you move forward. Not by pretending it didn’t happen, but by letting it change you.

The religious leaders in the story never got that. They were too proud, too set on their own power. They called Jesus a blasphemer for saying he’d sit at God’s right hand, but they missed who he was. Peter, for all his flaws, saw it. He saw Jesus take the abuse, stay silent, and trust God anyway. That’s what made Peter’s later words so powerful. He wasn’t preaching theory; he was preaching what he’d lived.

What’s the lesson here? Don’t be afraid to fail, but don’t hide from it either. Own it. Grieve it. Let it point you to something true. For Peter, that truth was Jesus’ forgiveness, a forgiveness so big it swallowed his betrayal and gave him a new life. It’s not just a nice story. It’s a way to live. When you’re at your lowest, when you’ve denied what matters most, there’s a way back. Not by your own effort, but by trusting the one who’s already paid for your mistakes. That’s what Peter learned, and it’s what he spent his life telling others. You can too.
