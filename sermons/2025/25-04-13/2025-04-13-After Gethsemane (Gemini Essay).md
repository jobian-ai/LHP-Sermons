# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 13 APRIL 2025 "After Gethsemane"

## The Distance We Keep

There's a strange human tendency to want to see how things end, but not to get too close while they're ending badly. You see this in the story of Peter during Jesus' trial. He followed, the account says, but at a distance. He wanted to know what would happen, to see the "end," but he kept himself far enough away to avoid getting caught up in it. He sat with the guards, an observer, not a participant.

It's a familiar posture. We watch from the sidelines when things get messy or uncomfortable. We want to know the outcome, but we're hesitant to get involved, especially if there's a risk to ourselves. Peter, who had so confidently declared his willingness to die for Jesus, now found himself in a courtyard, keeping his distance, afraid of being associated with the man being accused.

What did he see from that distance? He saw a council determined to condemn Jesus, twisting words and seeking false testimony. He saw pride in the high priest, demanding answers and tearing his robes in a theatrical display of outrage. And he saw brutality, men spitting on and striking someone who had done nothing wrong.

Faced with this, Peter's fear took over. A simple question from a servant girl was enough to trigger a denial, not just once, but three times, escalating with each encounter until he was swearing he didn't even know Jesus. The pressure, even from someone with no real power, was enough to make him abandon his earlier convictions.  

It's a stark reminder of how easily fear can override our intentions. Peter's initial bravado was no match for the immediate threat of being linked to a condemned man. His desire to see the end was stronger than his courage to stand by his friend.

The story doesn't end there, of course. Peter's denial is followed by a moment of sharp realization when the rooster crows, just as Jesus had predicted. The weight of his failure hits him, and he weeps bitterly. This is the point where the distance he kept didn't protect him from the emotional impact of his actions.

But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happens later. After Jesus' resurrection, he seeks out Peter, not with condemnation, but with a simple question: "Do you love me?" Three times he asks, mirroring Peter's three denials. And with each affirmation of love, Jesus gives Peter a task: "Feed my sheep."  

This suggests that failure isn't always the final word. Peter's denial was a significant lapse, a moment of profound weakness. Yet, he was given a chance to be restored, to take on responsibility, to lead. The distance he had kept in the courtyard was ultimately replaced by a deep commitment to the community Jesus left behind.

Maybe the lesson isn't just about the fallibility of our intentions, but also about the possibility of redemption. We might keep our distance when things get tough, we might even deny our connections when fear takes over. But the story of Peter hints that even after such failures, there might be a path back, a chance to move from being a distant observer to an active participant, driven not by fear, but by something stronger.
