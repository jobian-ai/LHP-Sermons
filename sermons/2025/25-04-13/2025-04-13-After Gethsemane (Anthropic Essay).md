# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 13 APRIL 2025 "After Gethsemane"

## What Peter Saw

The most vivid lessons often come from other people's failures. Not because we enjoy seeing someone else mess up, but because when someone else crashes their car, you get to learn about dangerous curves without having to crash yours. And when it comes to instructive failures, few are as educational as Peter's denial of Jesus.

I was thinking about this story recently - how Peter, one of Jesus's closest friends, ended up denying him three times on the night of his arrest. It's a story most people know even if they're not religious, but I think most of us miss what makes it so powerful.

Consider Peter's position. He had been with Jesus for years. He'd seen miracles. He'd walked on water (briefly). He had proclaimed Jesus as the Messiah. Hours before the denial, he had sworn he would die before disowning Jesus. And yet when confronted by a servant girl - not soldiers, not authorities, but a servant girl - he panicked and claimed he didn't even know Jesus.

What happened between his bold promise and his cowardly denial?

The text gives us a clue: Peter was "following at a distance." This physical distance mirrored what was happening inside him. He wanted to see what would happen to Jesus, but he didn't want to be associated with him. He was watching, but not participating.

That's when the trouble began. When we put distance between ourselves and our principles, we're setting ourselves up to abandon them entirely.

Look at the progression. First, Peter keeps a safe distance. Next, he sits with the guards - the very people who arrested Jesus. He's literally sitting with the opposition. Then when questioned, he denies Jesus with increasing intensity: first a simple denial, then with an oath, finally with curses.

It's a pattern we all recognize, though hopefully not in such stark terms. A small compromise leads to a larger one, then a complete reversal. The path from conviction to betrayal turns out to be shorter than we imagine.

What I find most interesting about this story isn't just the denial itself but what Peter witnessed while it was happening. He saw Jesus facing a corrupt trial. He watched as religious leaders brought in false witnesses. He observed Jesus remaining silent before baseless accusations, then speaking truth about his identity, even though it would lead to his condemnation. He saw Jesus being spit on, struck, and mocked - without fighting back.

In other words, Peter saw true courage while he was displaying its opposite.

What makes this especially powerful is how the story continues. This wasn't the end for Peter. After Jesus's resurrection, there's a moment by the Sea of Galilee where Jesus asks Peter three times if he loves him - once for each denial. It's not a punishment but a restoration. With each affirmation, Jesus gives Peter responsibility: "Feed my sheep."

Peter went on to become a pillar of the early church. The man who denied Christ ended up dying for him. In his letters, which we have in the Bible, he writes with authority about suffering for what's right - because he had learned the hard way what true courage looks like.

What changed? Peter learned that courage isn't about having no fear. It's about facing your fear and acting according to your principles anyway. He also discovered forgiveness - that failure isn't final.

There are a few things I think we can take from Peter's story.

First, small compromises matter. Peter didn't plan to deny Jesus. He just wanted to keep a safe distance and see what happened. But that distance made the denial almost inevitable. When we create space between what we believe and what we're willing to admit believing, we've already started down a path of betrayal.

Second, courage is learned, not innate. Peter thought he was brave when he promised to die with Jesus. Real courage came later, after he'd faced his failure and understood his weakness. There's no shame in being afraid. The shame comes in letting fear make our decisions for us.

Finally, failure isn't the end of the story. Peter's restoration contains one of the most hopeful messages of all: we can fail spectacularly and still be given another chance. Not just to rejoin the group, but to lead it.

We all face moments when staying true to our principles might cost us something. Most of us won't face life or death situations, but we all experience the pressure to deny what we believe, to keep a safe distance from unpopular truths, to sit with the guards rather than stand with the accused.

In those moments, Peter's story reminds us that the path of distance and denial leads to bitter tears, while the harder path of commitment, even when we're afraid, leads somewhere better.

And if we've already failed? Peter would remind us it's not too late to start again.
