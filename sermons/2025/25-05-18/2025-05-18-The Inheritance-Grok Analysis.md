SUMMARY (165 words)

The sermon on 1 Peter 1:3–5 explores the Christian’s living hope and guaranteed inheritance. Peter, an apostle, writes to elect exiles (Christians), emphasizing Jesus as the center of his message. Hope is defined as confident trust in God’s promises, rooted in His past actions, and described as living, authored by God through Christ’s resurrection. The inheritance—eternal life in a heavenly country—is imperishable (eternal), undefiled (sin-free), and unfading (ever-vibrant), contrasting with perishable, sin-defiled, fading earthly things. This inheritance is kept in heaven, guarded by God’s power through faith, ensured by the Holy Spirit. Salvation is past (justification), present (growth), and future (completion), freeing believers from sin and sorrow. The Gospel underscores humanity’s sinfulness, God’s justice, and Christ’s atoning sacrifice, calling for repentance and faith. Christians are urged to focus on this eternal inheritance, not losing heart despite life’s trials, and to live for God’s glory, resting in the Gospel daily.
