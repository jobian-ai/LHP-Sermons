**The Inheritance Problem**

There's something most people don't understand about inheritance. They think of it as money or property you get when someone dies. But that's not the only kind of inheritance, and it's probably not even the most important kind.

I was thinking about this while reading a letter written by someone who knew Jesus personally. The writer, Peter, talks about a different kind of inheritance entirely. One that doesn't depend on anyone dying to give it to you. In fact, it comes from someone who died and came back to life.

Peter describes this inheritance with three words that sound almost impossible when you put them together: imperishable, undefiled, and unfading. Let me explain why this matters.

**Everything Breaks**

We live in a world where everything has an expiration date. Your phone will break. Your car will break down. Your body will break down. Even the things we think of as permanent aren't really permanent. Companies that seemed unshakeable disappear. Relationships end. Entire civilizations rise and fall.

This isn't just true of physical things. It's true of everything we value. Your reputation can be destroyed overnight. Your skills become obsolete. Your memories fade. Even your best achievements eventually get forgotten.

Peter calls this being "perishable." We're like produce in a grocery store - we have a sell-by date, and no amount of careful handling can change that fact forever.

But what if there was something that didn't work this way?

**The Corruption Problem**

The second word Peter uses is "undefiled." This is harder to understand because we're so used to everything being corrupted in some way.

Think about the last genuinely good thing you did. Maybe you helped someone, or gave money to charity, or spent time with a friend who needed it. Now be honest: wasn't there some small part of you that felt good about how good you were being? Or maybe you hoped someone would notice? Or maybe you did it partly because it made you feel better about something else you'd done wrong?

This isn't a criticism. It's just how we work. Even our best actions are mixed up with other motivations. Everything we touch gets a little bit corrupted, not because we're trying to corrupt it, but because that's what broken people do to things.

Peter is describing something that isn't like this at all. Something completely pure, with no mixed motives, no hidden agendas, no corruption of any kind.

**The Fading Problem**

The third word is "unfading." This might be the saddest one, because we've all experienced it.

Remember being a kid and thinking your parents were the strongest, smartest people in the world? That faded. Remember being young and feeling like you could do anything? That faded too. Remember when you first fell in love, or had kids, or got your dream job? The intensity of those feelings faded.

This doesn't mean those things became worthless. But nothing stays at peak intensity forever. Energy fades. Enthusiasm fades. Even memories fade. That's just how time works.

But Peter is describing something that works differently. Something that gets more intense, not less. More real, not less. Something that never loses its color or its power.

**The Security Question**

Here's where it gets interesting. Peter doesn't just describe this inheritance - he explains how you can be sure you'll actually get it.

Most inheritances can be lost. The money can be stolen. The will can be contested. The company can go bankrupt. Even if you're supposed to inherit something, there's no guarantee you actually will.

But Peter says this inheritance is "kept in heaven for you." Think about what that means. Who can steal something that's kept in heaven? What court can contest a will that's filed there? What economic collapse can destroy assets that aren't part of any earthly economy?

And it's not just the inheritance that's protected. Peter says you are "being guarded through faith." There's active protection happening. Someone is making sure you don't lose your way before you get there.

**How This Works**

So how do you get this inheritance? Peter's answer is simple: faith.

But what does that mean practically? It means believing that someone else already did what you can't do yourself. It means trusting that when Jesus died, he was paying a debt you owed. It means accepting that you can't earn this inheritance - it has to be given to you.

This is counterintuitive. We're used to earning things. We work for our paychecks. We study for our grades. We train for our achievements. But this inheritance works differently. The harder you try to earn it, the further away from it you get.

Think of it like this: if someone offers to give you a gift, and you insist on paying for it, it's not a gift anymore. It's a purchase. And the whole point of this inheritance is that it's a gift from someone who wants to give it to you.

**Why This Matters**

You might be thinking: this sounds nice, but why should I care about some future inheritance when I have real problems now?

Here's why: knowing about this inheritance changes how you think about everything else.

If you know you have something imperishable coming, you don't have to desperately cling to the perishable things you have now. You can hold them lightly. You can enjoy them without being destroyed when they break.

If you know you have something undefiled waiting for you, you don't have to pretend your current life is perfect. You can acknowledge the corruption and brokenness around you and in you, without despair.

If you know you have something unfading ahead of you, you don't have to be crushed when the things you love start to fade. You can let them be what they are: temporary good things that point to permanent good things coming.

This isn't about ignoring your current life. It's about having the right perspective on it. It's about knowing where you're going so you can better navigate where you are.

**The Choice**

The strangest thing about this inheritance is that it's offered to everyone, but not everyone accepts it. Some people hear about it and think it sounds too good to be true. Others think they don't need it. Others want to earn it themselves.

But the offer stands. Someone who knew Jesus personally wrote down what Jesus told him to write. The inheritance is real. It's being kept for you. The only question is whether you want it.

If you do, the entry requirement isn't being good enough or smart enough or successful enough. It's just admitting you need it and trusting the person who's offering it to you.

That's it. No complicated process. No lengthy application. Just faith.

And once you have it, everything else becomes lighter. Not because your problems go away, but because you know they're temporary. You're going somewhere better, and Someone you trust is making sure you get there.

The inheritance is waiting. The question is whether you'll claim it.
