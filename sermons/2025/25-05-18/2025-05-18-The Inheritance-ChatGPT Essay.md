**The Inheritance**

When people hear the word “inheritance,” they usually think about something you get when someone dies—money, maybe, or an old house, or a few dusty boxes in the attic. Something left behind. Something fading. But that’s not how Peter talks about it. When he writes to the Christians scattered across the ancient world, he says something odd: he says their inheritance is alive.

That doesn’t quite compute at first. How can an inheritance be living? Isn't it something fixed, something waiting to be claimed once the paperwork clears?

Peter says no. This inheritance is different. He calls it “imperishable, undefiled, and unfading.” It’s not just better than a normal inheritance—it’s in a completely different category. Most inheritances come from the dead and eventually pass away. This one comes from the living God and doesn’t.

We don’t usually think of hope and inheritance in the same sentence, but Peter does. He says we've been born again to a _living hope_, and then he says we’ve also been born again to an _inheritance_. The connection isn’t accidental. The hope is living because the one who guarantees it—Jesus—is alive. And because he’s alive, so is the inheritance.

That makes a difference. We live in a world that’s constantly spoiling. Even our best memories blur. Everything fades. Your body. Your career. Your car. Your friendships, if you’re not careful. Everything, if left alone long enough, breaks down. But Peter says there is something you’ve been promised that doesn’t. He uses three simple words to describe it: imperishable, undefiled, and unfading.

**Imperishable** means it won’t rot. You don’t have to put it in the fridge or vacuum seal it. There’s no expiration date. No rust. No decay. And if you’re used to thinking of your life like a carton with a date stamped on it, that alone is a strange idea. We’re used to things running out. But this doesn’t.

**Undefiled** means it’s pure. We don’t have many categories for this. Most things we touch get dirty. Even our best motives have some pride tangled up in them. The inheritance Peter’s talking about isn’t just clean—it’s untouchable by sin. And not in a vague, metaphorical way. He means it’s real, and it stays real. Holy, even. Which means, terrifyingly, that in order to enjoy it, we’ll have to be made that way too.

**Unfading** is the hardest one to believe. Because even the good stuff in life—the really good stuff—eventually fades. You forget things. People move on. Memories blur. Youth slips away. But Peter says this inheritance is the opposite of that. It becomes clearer over time, not dimmer. More vivid, not less. It's the one thing that doesn’t dim as you draw near. Instead, you become more alive.

And in case you start thinking that this is just a beautiful idea, Peter adds something else. This inheritance, he says, is _kept_. Not by you. Not in a safety deposit box. It’s kept in heaven—by God. And not only that: you’re being kept too. Not by willpower. Not by consistency. But “by God’s power… through faith.”

That last phrase might be the most important. Through faith. That’s the key. Because this inheritance isn’t automatic. You don’t qualify for it by being born in the right family or by racking up enough good deeds. It’s not wages. It’s a gift. And the only way to receive a gift like this is to trust the giver.

Peter knows we forget this. That’s why he keeps repeating himself. God is guarding the inheritance. God is guarding you. Not just from things outside, but from things inside—like fear, or despair, or the kind of creeping cynicism that makes you forget this world isn’t your home.

He knows, too, that we suffer. That things get hard. That loss and disappointment are real. But he says even that isn’t wasted. Trouble, he says, has a function. It wakes us up. It reminds us that this life, however long or short, isn’t the whole story. It’s the part where we walk by faith. The next part is by sight.

Which is why Peter can talk about salvation as something still to come. Not because it hasn’t started, but because it’s not finished. The best part is still ahead. We’re not there yet. But we’re heading home.

And when we get there, we won’t find some faded relic in a box. We’ll find life—imperishable, undefiled, unfading. Not because we’ve earned it. But because we’ve been kept. Because He keeps what He promises. Because He keeps us.
