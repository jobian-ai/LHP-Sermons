# The Inheritance You Can’t Lose

I heard a sermon on 1 Peter recently, and it got me thinking about inheritance. Not the kind where you get your grandma’s jewelry, but something bigger, something Peter calls an “inheritance” for Christians. He’s writing to “elect exiles,” people chosen by God but living like strangers in this world. The sermon dug into this idea, and I realized it’s not just a dusty Bible word. It’s a way to see life, especially when everything feels like it’s falling apart.

Peter says this inheritance is three things: imperishable, undefiled, and unfading. Start with imperishable. Everything around us breaks down. Food spoils, cars rust, our bodies age. I know someone who buys every new health gadget, but nothing stops time. We’re “jars of clay,” the Bible says, fragile and temporary. Entire industries—diets, fitness apps—try to stretch our shelf life. But this inheritance doesn’t decay. It’s eternal, like God Himself. It’s life in a heavenly country, a new Jerusalem, Hebrews calls it. Chase money or status, and you rot with them. Set your heart on this, and you’re tied to forever.

Next, undefiled. Sin’s everywhere, like pollen you don’t notice till you sneeze. Even our best moments are tainted. You help someone, then feel smug when they thank you. Christians get this. We don’t brag about our good deeds because we know they’re mixed with pride or fear. Sin’s in the air, messing up everything. But this inheritance? It’s pure. No sin, no sorrow, no shame. It’s a place of perfect holiness, God’s light only. And when we get there, we’ll be pure too. No more guilt, no more second-guessing. That’s almost impossible to imagine, but it’s what Peter’s promising.

Then, unfading. Life fades. Memories blur, energy drains. The sermon mentioned a stuffed toy, Pop Tart, a kid’s treasure now faded to a colorless lump on a dashboard. That’s life. You retire, and your job’s a faint memory. You can’t recall if that family trip was Tuesday or Wednesday. Even love and dreams fade like old photos. But this inheritance doesn’t. It’s a place where everything sharpens, gets more alive. No fading memories, just clarity. You become more real, not less. It’s the opposite of here, where everything dims.

The best part? It’s guaranteed. Peter says it’s “kept in heaven for you.” Kept. Think about what you keep. Your phone, because it’s expensive. A letter, because it’s special. You lock doors, set alarms. This inheritance is in heaven, untouchable. No thief, no war can take it. And it’s for you, personal. Christians are God’s children, Paul says in Romans, heirs with Christ. God’s holding it, eager to give it.

But it’s not just the inheritance that’s safe. You are too. Peter says we’re “guarded through faith” by God’s power. Faith isn’t your willpower; it’s God’s gift, and He protects it. Paul says in Ephesians the Holy Spirit seals you, like a deposit on a house, ensuring you’ll get there. Life’s rough—disappointments, failures—but trouble pushes you to think about eternity. John Calvin said God uses hardship to loosen our grip on this world. It’s not cruelty; it’s focus.

This inheritance comes with salvation, but not just the “I got saved” moment. Salvation’s a process. It’s the cross behind you, faith growing now, and a future where sin, sorrow, and death are gone. You’ll never sin again, never cry, never die. That’s what’s waiting, Peter says, “ready to be revealed in the last time.”

How do you get it? Faith. Not effort, not being good enough. The Gospel says we’re sinners, deserving death. God’s just; sin must be punished. We can’t fix it ourselves—our best tries are tainted. But Jesus took that punishment, bore God’s wrath. Repent, trust Him, and this inheritance is yours. Ignore that, and you’re stuck, facing judgment with a ticking clock. Paul says in 2 Corinthians, don’t lose heart. This world’s fading, but the unseen is eternal.

Here’s the thing. Knowing this changes how you live. You don’t cling to stuff that breaks. You don’t sweat the small stuff—or even the big stuff. You’re free to live for something bigger, to rest in what’s sure. It’s like knowing you’ve got a home waiting, no matter what. That’s what Peter’s offering. It’s worth thinking about.
