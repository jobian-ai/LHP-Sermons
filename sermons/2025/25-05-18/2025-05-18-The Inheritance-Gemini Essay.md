# Inheritance

Writing about something, even something you've just heard, often shows you that you didn't quite grasp it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into your own words is a real test. You might start with one way of saying it, but then you have to try again, maybe several times, to get it to feel right. And the ideas themselves aren't just a little off; they're often incomplete. You'll probably find yourself thinking of new angles as you try to explain it. That's often why people write or, in this case, perhaps try to summarize what they've heard.

Today's topic was about inheritance, specifically the inheritance described in 1 Peter. It starts with the idea of being born again to a living hope through Jesus's resurrection. And then it talks about this inheritance that's promised to believers.

The usual idea of inheritance is something you get when someone dies, like money or possessions. But this inheritance is different. The one giving it, God, is alive. And what's being inherited isn't land, like in the Old Testament's promised land, but something more, a "heavenly country" or "new Jerusalem," as Hebrews puts it.

Peter uses three words to describe this inheritance. First, it's "imperishable." We know what perishable means—it spoils, it has a short life. The Bible says we are like that, "all flesh" is perishable. We break down physically, mentally, emotionally. We have whole industries trying to help us extend our "shelf life." But this inheritance? It's imperishable, immortal, it lasts forever. Jesus talked about this kind of treasure, not the earthly kind that moths and rust destroy, but treasure in heaven. If you focus only on what perishes, you perish with it. But if your heart is set on this imperishable treasure, this eternal life with God, then even though we die, we will live.

Second, the inheritance is "undefiled." Sin, breaking God's law, has infected everything, like it's in the air. We know that even our best actions are often mixed with things like pride or fear. But this inheritance is undefiled. It has no impurity, only perfect holiness. When we receive it, we will be made fully pure in a place untouched by sin, sorrow, or shame.

Third, it's "unfading." So much in our world fades, even the good things. A beloved old car gets worn, a cherished childhood toy loses its color. Events fade in our memory. Youth fades, energy fades, life itself fades. But this inheritance? Nothing about it fades. It's a place where everything becomes more alive, more clear. Reality as we've never seen it.

And this inheritance isn't just described; it's guaranteed. It's "kept in heaven for you." Think about what you keep and guard—things that are special or valuable. This inheritance is like that, kept and guarded in heaven, beyond theft or earthly troubles. And it's for "you," it's personal. As children of God through faith in Christ, we are heirs. God keeps and guards this inheritance for us, out of reach of the enemy.

Not only is the inheritance kept, but we are being guarded too, "by God's power through faith." God protects us from unbelief, knowing our weaknesses. He grows our faith. The Holy Spirit is the one doing this guarding, reminding us of who we are and where we're going, protecting our faith until we receive our inheritance. Trouble in this life can even serve a purpose, turning our thoughts to these eternal things.

This salvation isn't just a past event; it's something we are working out, and also something we look forward to. In the "last time," our salvation will be fully revealed. We will be saved from sin, sorrow, and death itself, forever with the Lord. Sin's penalty, power, and presence gone. This complete salvation, this inheritance, awaits us in God's kingdom.

How do we get this inheritance? "Through faith." Without faith, it's unattainable. To receive it, we need to repent and believe the Gospel. The Gospel tells us we deserve death as sinners, that God's judgment is real. It also says we can't fix this ourselves, we can never be good enough. But God, out of love, sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sins. If we repent, turn from our sins, and believe in Christ, trusting Him for our salvation, we receive eternal life and this inheritance as a gift. Without this, there is no inheritance.

For those who have this inheritance through faith, we're told not to lose heart, even though our outer selves are wasting away. This "light, momentary affliction" is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory. We should focus not on what we see, which is temporary, but on what is unseen, which is eternal. Keep your eyes on this inheritance, this unseen glory kept in heaven for you. Rest in the Gospel daily. Remember this imperishable, undefiled, unfading inheritance, and live with gratitude for God's glory.

This all feels quite secure, guaranteed for those in Christ. When you hear about this kingdom God has planned, held in His hand for you eternally, nothing should be more exciting. The sorrows now will be gone, the struggles will end, the sin we fight will disappear, and the fading life will fade no more. Only growth, joy, peace, light, life, righteousness, holiness, and being with God forever. Held in God's hand for you.
