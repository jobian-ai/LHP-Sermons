# The Parable of the Talents

When I was a kid, I hated those parts of the Bible with the weeping and gnashing of teeth. They scared me. I suppose they were meant to.

The parable of the talents is one of those stories. It appears in Matthew 25, and it's about a master who gives three servants different amounts of money before going on a journey. When he returns, two of the servants have doubled the money through investments, while the third just buried his portion in the ground.

The master is delighted with the first two servants, telling them "Well done, good and faithful servant... enter into the joy of your master." But the third servant gets a much different response. The master calls him "wicked and slothful," takes away his money, and has him thrown into "outer darkness" where there's "weeping and gnashing of teeth."

It's a striking story, especially if you've been raised to believe that God is watching your every move. What makes it even more striking is that it's clearly about more than just money.

If we step back and look at the structure of the parable, we can see that it's a metaphor about how we live our lives. The master represents God. The servants represent people. And the talents represent everything we've been given: our abilities, our resources, our opportunities, our very lives.

The message is straightforward: we're expected to do something with what we've been given. Not just preserve it, but multiply it.

This idea that life is a gift that we're meant to invest is powerful. In fact, the parable changed our language. The word "talent" originally meant a unit of money—a large amount of silver or gold. But now we use it to mean natural ability. This shift happened precisely because of this parable, where Jesus uses money as a metaphor for the gifts God gives us.

When I think about my own life through this lens, it's humbling. Everything I have—my mind, my health, my education, my relationships—was given to me. I didn't earn any of it at the beginning. The question is what I do with it.

I notice three things about how the servants in the parable respond:

First, there's promptness. The good servants "went at once" and put the money to work. They didn't procrastinate or overthink it. They acted.

Second, there's gratitude. The good servants seem to understand that what they've been given is a gift and an opportunity. They're grateful rather than resentful.

And third, there's courage. The good servants are willing to take risks. They invest the money rather than just burying it in the ground.

The servant who just buries his talent is paralyzed by a distorted view of the master. He sees the master as "a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed." Because he sees the master as harsh and unfair, he responds with fear rather than trust. And fear leads to paralysis.

It's striking how differently the servants see the same master. The first two see him as someone worth pleasing, someone whose joy they want to enter into. The third sees him as cruel and unfair.

I think this happens with God too. Some people see God as harsh and arbitrary. Others see him as generous and trustworthy. And how you see God dramatically affects how you live.

The first two servants say "you delivered to me" the talents, recognizing that what they have is a gift. The third servant says "I knew you to be a hard man," defining his master by what he demands rather than what he gives.

I find it significant that the master responds identically to the servant who made five talents and the one who made two. The master isn't comparing the servants to each other. He's looking at what each one did with what they were given.

This is liberating. We're not all given the same talents or opportunities. But we're all called to use what we have. It's not about the absolute results; it's about faithfulness with what we've been entrusted.

When I reflect on this parable, I ask myself: What have I been given? What am I doing with it? Am I investing it or burying it? Do I see God as harsh and unfair, or as generous and trustworthy?

And perhaps most importantly: Do I understand that everything I have is a gift—that my life itself is a gift—and that I'm called to invest it rather than just preserve it?

The most haunting part of the parable is that the unfaithful servant isn't punished for doing something wrong, but for doing nothing. He didn't waste the money or steal it. He just didn't do anything with it. And that was enough to condemn him.

This suggests that the sin of omission—the failure to do good when we have the opportunity—is just as serious as the sin of commission, doing something explicitly wrong.

So how should we live in light of this parable?

First, we should recognize that everything we have is a gift, entrusted to us by God. Our abilities, our resources, our relationships, our opportunities—all of it.

Second, we should invest rather than bury what we've been given. This means taking some risks. It means being willing to fail. It means not letting fear paralyze us.

Third, we should focus on being faithful with what we've been given, rather than comparing ourselves to others. God doesn't expect the same from all of us. He expects us to use what we've been given, however much or little that is.

And finally, we should remember that the goal isn't just to preserve what we've been given, but to multiply it. The master doesn't just want his money back; he wants a return on his investment.

The good news is that there is joy at the end of this road. "Enter into the joy of your master," the faithful servants are told. This suggests that using what we've been given isn't just our duty; it's also the path to joy.

If we understand that our lives are gifts to be invested rather than possessions to be protected, we'll live differently. We'll be more grateful, more courageous, and ultimately, more joyful.

And maybe, just maybe, we'll hear those words we all long to hear: "Well done, good and faithful servant."
