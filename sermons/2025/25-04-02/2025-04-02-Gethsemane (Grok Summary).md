# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 02 APRIL 2025 "Gethsemane"

## Key Topics and Definitions from the Lecture

1\. The Two Key Prayers of Jesus

- Definition: The lecture highlights two significant prayers attributed to Jesus that Christians often learn early in their faith journey.

  - The Lord's Prayer: A well-known prayer that Christians soon get to know and pray, though not detailed in this specific passage.

  - The Gethsemane Prayer: The prayer uttered in the Garden of Gethsemane, summarized as "Not my will, but yours be done," reflecting Jesus’ submission to God’s will before his crucifixion.

2\. The Garden of Gethsemane

- Definition: A cultivated olive grove or orchard just outside Jerusalem, known as the site of Jesus’ most intense praying and his subsequent arrest.

  - Significance: It is where Jesus prayed fervently before his death, expressing deep sorrow and submitting to God’s will, and where Judas betrayed him.

3\. Jesus’ Predictions and Disciples’ Responses

- Definition: Jesus made three specific predictions to his disciples en route to Gethsemane, met with their declarations of loyalty.

  - First Prediction: "You will all fall away because of me this night," quoting Zechariah’s prophecy, "I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."

  - Second Prediction: "But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee," indicating a future reunion post-resurrection.

  - Third Prediction: To Peter, "This very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times," foretelling Peter’s specific failure.

  - Disciples’ Response: Led by Peter, they assert, "I will never fall away," and "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you," reflecting their good intentions despite their later actions.

4\. The Sorrow of Jesus

- Definition: Jesus’ emotional state in Gethsemane, described as profound sorrow and loneliness, stemming from multiple sources.

  - Sorrow of Loneliness: Jesus felt abandoned as one friend (Judas) betrayed him, another (Peter) denied him, and all disciples fled, leaving him alone except for his connection to the Father.

  - Sorrow of Rejection: Anticipation of physical suffering (e.g., being spat upon, whipped, crucified) and rejection by crowds who once supported him.

  - Sorrow of the Cup: The greatest sorrow, tied to drinking "the cup" of God’s wrath against sin, culminating in the moment of forsakenness on the cross ("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me").

5\. The Cup

- Definition: A metaphorical representation of God’s wrath poured out on sin, which Jesus willingly accepted on the cross.

  - Details: Described as the moment Jesus became sin for humanity, experiencing the absence of God’s presence (Hell itself), a burden only the fully divine and human Son of God could bear.

  - Purpose: By drinking this cup, Jesus secured salvation for sinners, taking their punishment so they could receive grace.

6\. Good Intentions vs. Weak Flesh

- Definition: The contrast between the disciples’ heartfelt desire to remain loyal to Jesus and their inability to follow through due to human weakness.

  - Example: The disciples vowed loyalty ("I will never fall away"), yet slept while Jesus prayed and fled at his arrest, illustrating "The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

  - Application: Extended to all people who aspire to be better but struggle against their sinful nature, needing God’s Spirit to fulfill good intentions.

7\. Fulfillment of Scripture

- Definition: The events in Gethsemane and beyond as the realization of Old Testament prophecies pointing to Jesus’ suffering and salvation.

  - Examples: Includes Zechariah’s shepherd prophecy, Isaiah’s suffering servant, Jeremiah’s new covenant, Genesis’ serpent-crushing promise, and Psalm 22’s forsaken Son, all converging on Christ’s actions.

8\. Call to Watchfulness and Prayer

- Definition: A recurring biblical exhortation, exemplified by Jesus’ request to his disciples and extended to Christians, to remain vigilant and prayerful.

  - Jesus’ Instruction: "Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation," unmet by the sleeping disciples.

  - Broader Teaching: Reinforced by parables (e.g., "Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour") and Paul’s words (e.g., "Continue steadfastly in prayer. Be watchful in it with thanksgiving").
