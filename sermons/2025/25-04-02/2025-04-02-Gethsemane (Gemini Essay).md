# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 02 APRIL 2025 "Gethsemane"

## The Gap Between Intention and Action

We've all had the experience of wanting to do something, really wanting to, and then failing. It's a familiar gap, the one between our intentions, which can feel so strong and true, and our actual ability to follow through. Reading about the disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane, you see this gap laid bare in a particularly stark way. They genuinely believed they would stand by Jesus, even to death. They said so, emphatically. But when the moment came, they all fell asleep, and then fled.

It's easy to judge them, to see their failure as a lack of commitment. But maybe it's more about the inherent weakness of being human. They _wanted_ to be loyal. They likely pictured themselves as brave and steadfast. But when faced with the reality of Jesus' sorrow, and perhaps their own fear, their good intentions simply weren't enough. Their "flesh was weak," as Jesus himself put it.

This resonates beyond religious contexts. How many times have we set out to achieve something, full of enthusiasm, only to find our resolve fading when things get difficult? We intend to exercise regularly, to learn a new skill, to finish that project. The desire is there, but the execution often falls short. Life gets in the way, or we simply lack the inner strength to push through.

The disciples' experience also highlights the profound loneliness that can come with bearing a heavy burden. Jesus, facing immense suffering, asked his closest friends to watch and pray with him. He needed their support, even just their presence. But they couldn't even stay awake. It's a painful image, the one of someone facing a monumental task feeling utterly alone, even among those who care about them.

And then there's the idea of the "cup" that Jesus prayed about. It represents something deeply difficult, something he wished to avoid if possible, yet ultimately accepted as necessary. This speaks to a larger truth about facing challenges. Often, the things we need to do are the hardest things, the ones we instinctively want to turn away from. But there's a sense that these difficult paths, these "cups" we must drink, are sometimes the only way forward, the only way to fulfill a larger purpose.

The disciples' story, in this light, isn't just a historical account. It's a reminder of the common human struggle to bridge the gap between our aspirations and our actions. We might have the best intentions, the strongest desires, but our human limitations often get in the way. And sometimes, the most profound and necessary tasks are those we face alone, even when surrounded by others who mean well. It's a sobering thought, but also a strangely comforting one, to know that this struggle is a fundamental part of the human condition.
