# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 02 APRIL 2025 "Gethsemane"

## Not My Will, But Yours

When we look at those moments before Jesus was arrested, we find ourselves confronted with one of the most intense scenes in all of Scripture. In the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus faces what he knows is coming, and it almost crushes him.

What's remarkable is how ordinary the evening begins. They've just had dinner. They sang a hymn—probably some of the Psalms. They're walking to where they'd normally spend the night. It seems like any other evening, except for the weight of what's about to happen.

I want to focus on three things we see in this passage: the disciples' good intentions and failure, Jesus' profound sorrow, and the fulfillment of God's plan through it all.

First, the disciples. They wanted so badly to be loyal to Jesus. When he predicted they would all fall away, Peter jumped in immediately: "Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away." And the rest quickly joined him. They were certain of their commitment.

There's something familiar about this. Most of us overestimate our own spiritual strength. We believe we're more loyal, more committed, more spiritually mature than we actually are. The disciples couldn't imagine abandoning Jesus. But their confidence would soon be tested.

In the garden, Jesus asked them to do one simple thing: stay awake and pray with him while he went through his darkest hour. He took Peter, James, and John—his inner circle—and told them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death." This wasn't mild discouragement. This was sorrow that felt like it could kill him.

And what did the disciples do? They fell asleep. Not once, but three times. Jesus returns to find them sleeping when he needed them most. "Could you not watch with me one hour?" The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

I find this both discouraging and encouraging. Discouraging because if even the disciples, who walked with Jesus daily, couldn't stay faithful in his hour of need, what hope do I have? But encouraging because it means Jesus understands our weakness. He knows what it's like to be let down by friends. He knows what it's like when our spirit is willing but our flesh is weak.

The second thing I want to focus on is Jesus' sorrow. This wasn't just anxiety about physical pain. Jesus had endured rejection before. He knew he would be raised again—he had told them so explicitly. So what could possibly make him "sorrowful unto death"?

It was the cup. Three times he prays, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from me." The cup represents God's wrath against sin that Jesus would bear on the cross. When Jesus says on the cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" he's experiencing something beyond our comprehension—the full weight of God's judgment against all human sin.

Jesus wasn't just facing physical torture and death. He was facing separation from the Father. For the eternal Son who had never experienced a moment out of perfect communion with the Father, this was a horror beyond anything we can imagine.

And yet, each time he prays about the cup, he concludes, "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will." In his moment of greatest distress, Jesus submits to the Father's plan. This is love beyond measure—that he would willingly drink this cup for us.

The third element here is how all this fulfills Scripture. Twice Jesus says explicitly that what's happening must occur to fulfill the Scriptures. The shepherd struck, the sheep scattered. The suffering servant bearing our sins. The new covenant established through his blood.

When Peter draws his sword and cuts off the servant's ear, Jesus stops him. This isn't about military resistance. Jesus could have called twelve legions of angels—perhaps 72,000 supernatural warriors—to rescue him. But he doesn't, because "how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"

Jesus knew from the beginning where this path led. The garden wasn't the place where the plan went wrong—it was exactly where it was always heading. The betrayal, the arrest, the abandonment, the cross—all of it was necessary for our salvation.

This is what makes the Lord's Supper so meaningful. When we take the cup, we're remembering that Jesus took a different cup for us. He drank the cup of God's wrath so that we could drink the cup of blessing and salvation.

When I look at this passage, I see both tremendous failure and tremendous love. The disciples' failure reminds me of my own weakness, but Jesus' love shows me that weakness isn't the end of the story.

I've often wondered what I would have done in the garden. Would I have stayed awake? Would I have fled when they came to arrest him? I suspect I know the answer. But the good news isn't that we're strong enough to stay awake. The good news is that Jesus loved us enough to drink the cup even when we couldn't keep our eyes open.

Most of us have moments when we feel alone, when even those closest to us don't understand what we're going through. Jesus experienced the ultimate aloneness on the cross. But he did it willingly, because of love.

So what do we take from this? First, humility about our own spiritual strength. If we think we'll never deny Jesus, we're setting ourselves up for a fall. Second, gratitude for what Jesus endured for us. And third, a commitment to stay spiritually awake and watchful in a world that wants to lull us to sleep.
