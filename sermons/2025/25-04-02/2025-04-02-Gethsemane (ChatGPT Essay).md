# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 02 APRIL 2025 "Gethsemane"

## The Road to the Garden

People think failure comes from bad intentions. Sometimes it does. But most of the time, it doesn't. Most of the time it comes from good intentions paired with weak execution. The road to the garden was paved with the best intentions anyone ever had.

Peter really meant what he said. “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” The others said the same. I don’t think they were lying. They were just wrong. They thought their loyalty was stronger than it was. That’s usually how it works. People don’t plan to fail. They just assume they’re better than they are.

Jesus told them plainly what would happen. He would be struck, and the sheep would scatter. He even told Peter exactly how it would go: three denials before the rooster crowed. And still they didn’t believe him. That part’s familiar too. People don’t like being told they’re weaker than they imagine themselves to be. Especially not by someone they love.

What makes this moment stand out isn't just that they failed. It’s that they failed so quickly. Just hours earlier, they were swearing undying loyalty. Now they’re asleep while Jesus is grieving. And when the soldiers arrive, they all flee.

If the story stopped there, it would be a story about failure. But it doesn’t stop there.

The most surprising thing about the Gethsemane scene is that Jesus asks for something. That’s not the version of Jesus most people have in mind. We think of him as always giving, always teaching, always strong. But here, he’s in agony. He’s sorrowful even to death. And he asks his closest friends for one thing: to stay awake.

They couldn’t do it.

He tells them the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. That line could sum up most of human history. It’s not that people don’t want to do the right thing. It’s that they don’t have the strength to follow through. That’s what the disciples showed us. That’s what we show, over and over.

When Jesus prays, he asks if there’s another way. “If it is possible, let this cup pass from me.” That’s the part most people skip over. But it’s important. Because it shows us that Jesus wasn’t just obeying out of duty. He wanted another way. He just wanted his Father’s will more.

That prayer—“Not my will, but yours be done”—is one of the most famous lines in the Bible. And for good reason. It’s the clearest picture we have of what it looks like to submit completely. Not blindly, not because you have no feelings about it. But because you trust the one asking.

Jesus knew what was coming. The loneliness, the rejection, the torture. But more than that, the cup. The wrath of God poured out on sin. People argue about what that means, but at the very least, it meant being utterly alone. Even the Father turning his face away. That’s the part Jesus dreaded most.

You can see it in the repetition. Three times he prays the same thing. Not because he thinks God didn’t hear him the first time. But because that’s how real sorrow works. It circles. It pleads. It tries again, even when it knows the answer.

What’s strange is how calm Jesus is when the soldiers come. Judas kisses him. Peter panics and cuts off someone’s ear. Jesus heals the man and tells Peter to put away his sword. “All who take the sword will perish by the sword.” That’s not the strategy Peter was hoping for.

Jesus could have called legions of angels. He says so. But if he had, the Scriptures wouldn’t be fulfilled. That line—"how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled?"—is everything. That’s the frame. That’s the reason he doesn’t run, or fight, or ask for a miracle. It must be this way.

Most people think Jesus came to die on the cross. That’s true, but it’s not the full truth. He came to fulfill the Scriptures. To complete the story that had been unfolding since Genesis. That’s why he talks about Zechariah and the striking of the shepherd. That’s why he mentions the prophets. None of this is random. It’s all part of a pattern. And he knows the pattern.

People sometimes think of the cross as the climax. But Gethsemane might be the real turning point. That’s where Jesus decided—for the final time—to go through with it. That’s where the sacrifice began. Not with nails, but with prayer. That’s where he gave up control.

And the disciples? They slept through it.

That’s not just a detail. That’s the point. Because most of us are more like the disciples than we are like Jesus. We want to be there for the people we love. We want to do the right thing. But our eyes get heavy. Our minds wander. We forget what’s at stake. We fall asleep.

The hope of the story is not that the disciples got it right. They didn’t. The hope is that Jesus was faithful even when they weren’t. That he submitted to the Father’s will even when his best friends let him down. That he drank the cup so we wouldn’t have to.

When we take the Lord’s Supper, we think about the body and the blood. But it’s also worth remembering the garden. The sorrow. The prayer. The cup. That moment where everything could have gone another way. And didn’t.

Because Jesus stayed awake. Because he said yes when everything in him wanted to say no.

That’s what love looks like.
