# The Final Judgment

When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the idea of judgment day. Not in a morbid way, but with genuine curiosity about how it might work. The Bible describes it with vivid imagery that seems both straightforward and mysterious at the same time.

Perhaps you've wondered about this too. In Matthew 25, Jesus gives one of the clearest pictures we have of the final judgment. It's simple yet profound - a scene where all people are gathered before Christ, who separates them into two groups, "as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."

What's striking isn't just the division itself, but how it happens.

## Two Groups, Not Many

First, notice there are only two groups. Not three, five, or ten - just sheep and goats. In our day-to-day lives, we tend to see people along a spectrum: devout believers, nominal Christians, spiritual-but-not-religious types, agnostics, atheists, and so on. We create these complex taxonomies of belief.

But in Jesus's picture, there's a single dividing line. You're either a sheep or a goat. This binary division cuts against our modern sensibility that prefers nuance and gradations. It suggests something fundamental about reality that transcends our preference for complexity.

## Identity Precedes Actions

The second thing that stands out is that Jesus separates them based on who they are, not just what they've done. This is subtle but crucial. The sheep act like sheep, and the goats act like goats, but they were sheep or goats first. Their identity precedes their actions.

This addresses a common misreading of the passage. Some people read it and think, "I'd better start visiting prisons and feeding the hungry, or I'll end up with the goats." But that misses the point. The passage isn't teaching salvation by works. Rather, it shows that works flow from identity. The sheep don't become sheep by doing sheep things; they do sheep things because they're sheep.

I see this pattern throughout the New Testament. We're not told to behave well so that God will accept us; we're told that God accepts us in Christ, and therefore we should behave in accordance with our new identity. Action follows being.

## The Surprising Connection

Perhaps the most unexpected element in this scene is how both groups respond with surprise. Both the sheep and the goats ask essentially the same question: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison?" Neither group realized they were interacting with Jesus.

What's going on here? Jesus makes an astonishing claim: "As you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me." He identifies himself so closely with his followers that serving them is equivalent to serving him.

This reminds me of when Saul (later Paul) was confronted on the road to Damascus. Jesus didn't ask, "Why are you persecuting my followers?" He asked, "Why are you persecuting me?" There's a profound union between Christ and his people that most of us, including many Christians, don't fully grasp.

This has two implications. First, it means that the Christian sitting next to you is incredibly precious to Jesus. How you treat them matters deeply to him. Second, it means that you yourself, if you're a believer, are similarly precious. When others mistreat you, Jesus takes it personally.

## The Final Invitation

For the sheep - those who belong to Christ - the judgment ends with an invitation: "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

Notice the language of inheritance. In normal circumstances, receiving an inheritance means the giver has died. But in this case, the inheritance is enjoyed with the giver. It's relationship, not just reward.

And the timing is striking too - this kingdom was "prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Before you did anything, before you even existed, God was preparing your place in his kingdom.

This mirrors what Paul writes in Ephesians 1, that God "chose us in him before the foundation of the world" and "predestined us for adoption." Our salvation isn't a reaction to our good behavior; it's the outworking of God's eternal plan, rooted in his grace.

The invitation at the end - "Come" - echoes Jesus's earlier invitations: "Come, follow me" and "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden." Those who respond to the first "come" will hear the final "come."

## The Alternative

The passage also describes the fate of the goats. Jesus uses some of his strongest language here: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."

The terror of this judgment is real. It's not something to gloss over or reinterpret away. But neither should it paralyze believers with anxiety about whether they've done enough good works. The point isn't to make sheep worry they might be goats; it's to motivate sheep to act like sheep, and to warn those who are currently goats that there's still time to become sheep.

## What This Means Now

If you're already a believer, this passage isn't meant to make you anxious. It's meant to remind you that your actions matter, that how you treat other believers matters especially, and that one day you'll hear "Come, you blessed of my Father."

And if you're not yet a believer? Then Jesus's first invitation still stands. Before the final "come," there's the present "come to me." Before the judgment, there's the offer of grace.

The final judgment is coming. But for those in Christ, it's not a threat but a promise - the day when what is now true in principle becomes true in experience, when the King says "Come" one last time, and we enter fully into the joy that's been prepared for us from the foundation of the world.
