## The Second Coming of the King

For Christians, the second coming of Christ is not a question of if, but when. Jesus himself made this clear: no one knows the exact time, but one day, he will return in glory to judge the living and the dead. This will not be a hidden event, not a quiet return like his first coming in a manger. This time, it will be unmistakable. The King will come, and all will see him.

Matthew 25 paints a picture of what that day will be like. Jesus will sit on his throne, and before him, all nations will be gathered. There will be a great separation—sheep on his right, goats on his left. The sheep will inherit the kingdom prepared for them, while the goats will be sent into eternal punishment. It is a final and inescapable judgment.

This passage makes an important distinction. The separation is not about what people did, but who they are. Identity comes first. The sheep are not saved because of their good works; they do good works because they are saved. Their actions flow from who they are. The goats, on the other hand, may have lived seemingly moral lives, but they were never truly known by Christ.

Jesus explains that the way we treat his people is the way we treat him. "As you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me." This is a striking statement. It means that our love for Christ is shown in our love for his people. Hospitality, generosity, compassion—these are not just good deeds; they are acts of worship. They reveal what is in our hearts.

But the reverse is also true. Neglecting the needs of fellow believers is neglecting Christ himself. The goats are not condemned because of outright rebellion, but because they ignored Christ in the needs of his people. Their indifference showed that they were never truly his.

The final judgment is both terrifying and glorious. Terrifying, because it is final. There are no second chances. Glorious, because for those in Christ, it is the moment of ultimate joy. "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." This invitation is not a reward for good behavior. It is the fulfillment of God's eternal plan, a gift of grace given before we could do anything to deserve it.

For believers, this passage should not create fear but urgency. It reminds us that everything we do matters. Our works do not save us, but they reflect the reality of our salvation. Our love for one another is the mark of a true disciple. And our calling is to invite others to know Christ, to extend to them the same invitation we have received: "Come and see."

Jesus is coming again. And when he does, there will be no mistaking it. Every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess. The only question is, will we be found as sheep or as goats? May we be found ready, rich in good works, and rejoicing in the coming of our King.
