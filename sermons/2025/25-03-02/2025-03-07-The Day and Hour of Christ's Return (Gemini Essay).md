# When Will Jesus Return?

Christians declare every week in the Apostles' Creed that Jesus Christ will come again to judge the living and the dead. This is taught in many places in the Bible, including today's Scripture text.

We're nearing the end of the Gospel of Matthew. The conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders is increasing. Jesus is having a private conversation with his disciples. It started because Jesus said the Temple would be destroyed. The disciples asked him when that would happen.

Last week we looked at the beginning of his response, how he spoke about Jerusalem and its destruction. Now he moves from that time to the end of the age, to the Second Coming. Today we're going to begin our consideration of what Jesus says to the disciples about this.

So hear the word of the Lord this morning from Matthew 24, beginning at verse 36. But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood, they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away. So will be the coming of the Son of Man.  

Then two men will be in the field. One will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill. One will be taken and one left. Therefore stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready. For the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.  

Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has set over his household to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself, my master is delayed, and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and in an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  

Then the kingdom of heaven will be like 10 virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them. But the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. And as the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, here is the bridegroom, come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, since there will not be enough for us, and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.  

While they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered, truly, I say to you, I do not know you. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour. This is the word of the Lord this morning.  

So when will Jesus return? Christians have wondered about this since the earliest days of the church. The history of the world is full of alleged second comings. People report that Jesus has come again, and there are Bible codes and methods that people have used to try to determine dates and times in the Bible. They apply their puzzle solving techniques. This has led to some of the strangest and most distracting and harmful things for God's people.

Christians have been led into unfruitful distraction as they have focused on a single day that some person says is the day Jesus is going to return. During our men's Bible study last week, I was reminded of one of the classic end time stories, The Late Great Planet Earth. More recently there was the Left Behind book series and movie, which even had its own board game.

The level of goofiness that has emerged through alleged careful Bible study and finding hidden codes and secrets might make one cautious about even talking about the Second Coming. It's gotten weird a lot of times. But we have to set the distractions aside and look at what Jesus is actually saying to his disciples and to us here. It's not weird. It's important. It's not trivial. It's not silly. It's very real.

What Jesus begins by saying is what all those careful Bible students who predicted the exact dates of Jesus's return have decided to ignore. But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. Jesus makes this declaration. Then he gives us an illustration. He says, it's like in Noah's day. The people were eating and drinking and marrying. They were just living their lives as it ever was until it wasn't. Until the day when Noah entered the ark, Jesus says, and the flood came and swept them all away.

Jesus wants us to know some things about his return. The first is that no one knows the day. Unlike the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, where Jesus gave them signs, there are no signs given. No one knows when it will happen. Christ will come again when the Father's will calls for him to come again. As for us, we will be eating and drinking and marrying.

Jesus describes the Second Coming. He says there's two men in the field, doing normal things. And one is suddenly swept away. Two women grinding at a mill, doing normal daily work. And then all of a sudden, everything changes. One of them is swept away.

The second thing is that the Second Coming will be sudden and immediate and final. There is no siege. There is no extra time for a person to flee. There are no second chances. There are no warning signs. It's sudden and immediate and final.

The third thing is that there will be a division. There will be those who are swept away and those who are not.

The fourth thing is that it will be universal and visible. It's like in Noah's day. Everyone's included. And Jesus has already declared previously that when he comes, it won't be hidden. It's not like when he came as a baby. When he comes again, there'll be no doubt. His coming will be like the lightning that comes from the east and shines as far as the west. There will be no confusing what's happening. It'll be universal. It'll be visible.

Jesus instructs his disciples. He says, since this is the way it's going to be, you must be alert. You don't know on what day the Lord is coming. So be alert. If the master of a house had known when the thief would come, he would have stayed awake. But since you don't know, you got to stay awake all the time. You got to be awake. You got to be alert. You don't know when. And so you also must be ready. The Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.

What does that mean? How is one to be ready for such an event? Jesus hints at what he means by using the example of Noah. Noah built the ark in obedience to the Lord, and he got into it. He was a righteous man. He trusted the Lord. He did what the Lord called him to do in obedience.

Jesus tells a parable about a couple of servants to illustrate further these things about his coming again. He paints this picture. There's this servant set over the household. He's got a job, a purpose. He's supposed to make sure everybody has food. This requires discipline and attention to detail and knowledge and leadership and personal skill.

The master goes away and leaves the servant to do what he's asked him to do. There's a delay. Then the master shows up. What does he see? Jesus describes two kinds of servants, the faithful servant and the wicked servant. What kind of servant is he?

The faithful servant has been faithful in his work for the master. He's been trustworthy, high integrity, good at what he does, and he serves with a sincere heart. The master comes and finds him doing his work, doing what he's been called to do. He's active.

The reward is additional responsibility. Greater labors, greater blessings. In the kingdom of the master.

The wicked servant sees that the master is delayed. He starts beating the other servants. He's like a glutton and a drunkard. He takes stuff for himself. He's about himself. He doesn't value the master. He doesn't value the master's things. He doesn't value the master's servants. He only grabs for himself. He doesn't value the work he's been given to do.

The reward is destruction. He'll be cut into pieces by the master and put with the hypocrites in hell.

The faithful servant is always thinking about the master and how to please him. He doesn't need to worry about when the master returns. The wicked servant doesn't think about the master much. He thinks about himself. He ought to worry about the master returning. The faithful and the wicked servant.

We see again, no one knows the day the master will come. It will be sudden, immediate, final. The master comes with judgment. The judgment against wickedness is severe and final. There will be a division. The wicked servant is judged and dies. The faithful servant is rewarded. It'll be personal. It's the master who's coming. He will look at each of us and he will make his judgment.

Jesus shows by way of this illustration what the Lord is calling them to do. Be faithful in his service, show wisdom in fearing the Lord and loving him as the master. This will work itself out in every area of your life. All of us have been given great responsibilities in God's kingdom. May we serve Christ in them all. May we be so about living a faithful Christian life and loving Christ, the master in our hearts that our minds aren't anxious about when Christ might return. We're looking forward to it. We want to meet him. We love to serve him. We love to do the things that he's calling us to do.

When I was young, we went to my aunt's house. We loved going to her house. But there were a couple things. One was that she had this really scary scarecrow where we had to sleep. The other was we would be sitting in her kitchen, playing cards, and I would be cheating, trying to see what my brothers were doing. She had this cross stitch that was up, and it was like, if Jesus returned today, what would he find you doing? I remember being terrified by this picture. What if when Jesus returned at that moment, I wasn't doing something good?

Is that what Jesus is saying? The faithful servant and the wicked servant picture is about a life. It's not that you're living faithfully, and then Christ comes at the moment when you're particularly sinning.

Jesus here depicts the faithful servant as one who's thinking about his return with grateful anticipation, not anxiety. He's about his tasks. For the Christian, that task can include the task of confessing sin. We ought to want to repent of it quickly because in some ways, the little picture was right. Would I really want Christ to come and find me cheating and looking at my brother's cards? We repent of things quickly. We don't want to hold on to those things. We don't want to develop a wicked heart.

Jesus tells his disciples one final parable to drive the point home about his coming. He tells of these 10 virgins, young girls that were part of a wedding celebration. They were supposed to lead the wedding party there.

They all had lamps. They all looked the same on the outside. But five of them were foolish and five of them were wise. The wise took some extra oil with them and the foolish didn't. The bridegroom is delayed, and the girls go to sleep.

Everybody's sleeping. Then the cry comes that the bridegroom is near and the sleeping young girls are all awakened. The foolish ask if they can borrow some of the oil from the wise ones. The wise ones say, no. The foolish ones have to leave. The bridegroom heads into the wedding feast and the wise girls are invited in. The foolish ones are locked out. They try to get in. But the bridegroom answers, truly, I say to you, I do not know you.

There is a division. There are the five wise and there are the five foolish. There is a suddenness, a finality. The cry goes out, the bridegroom comes. There's no time for them to fix their problems. They're locked out. It will be personal. The bridegroom is also the doorkeeper. He looks in their eyes and he tells them that, I do not know you.

There will be those who, when Jesus comes again, he will look directly into their eyes and say those terrible words. Truly, I say to you, I do not know you. But to the wise, he looks into their eyes and he invites them into the feast.

There's a call here to responsibility. You're responsible for yourself. There's no borrowing oil. You've got to have your own oil. You've got to be spiritually ready yourself.

Jesus has told his disciples his Second Coming is going to be on a day and in an hour that no one knows. It will be visible and unmistakable. It will be personal. It will be sudden. There will be a final division between those who belong to the king and those who don't.

Which are you? When Jesus returns, there will be no extra time to consider that question. We will all face the master. We will all face the king.

Until that time, the Scriptures call on us as Christians to be prepared. Confess your sins, strive to know Christ, to be faithful, actively doing what the Lord has called you to do, to be ready, to be watchful, alert in prayer, desiring God's will in the world to be done. Though we don't know the day or the hour, we know that the end is nearer today than yesterday. And it can be at any time.

Knowing this, the apostles gave out instructions. Be steadfast, be immovable, always abound in the work of the Lord. Let's be sober. Let's put on the breastplate of faith and love and the hope of salvation. Encourage one another. Build one another up with these words. Be patient, establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Don't grumble. The judge is standing at the door. The end of all things is at hand. Be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. Keep loving one another earnestly. Use your gifts to serve one another. Whoever speaks as one who speaks the oracles of God. Whoever serves as one who serves with the strength that God supplies in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.  

Today, at this moment, Jesus has not yet come. So we will do what we always do. We will worship him and we will, in the Lord's Supper, proclaim his death. We will do that until he comes.

Why the delay? The Apostle Peter reminds us that the reason for the delay is the patience of God shown in the spread of the Gospel. Don't overlook one fact. Don't overlook that with the Lord, one day is a thousand years, and a thousand years is a day. The Lord isn't slow to fulfill his promise. His delay isn't because he forgot. The Lord isn't slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but he's patient towards you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.  

The patience of the Lord is the reason for the delay. But Christ is coming again. The time is nearer every hour.

May we never be afraid of that fact, but may we give our lives to his faithful service at all times, being a people of prayer, faith, obedience, encouraging one another each and every day, loving one another as we were instructed, grateful that we have been called to be a part of the kingdom of God. And when he comes suddenly, visibly, personally, at a day and a time when nobody knows, may we be waiting, rejoicing, ready to welcome, praise and joy our glorious king, ready to sit at his wedding banquet, ready to serve and love and admire our glorious king, our glorious bridegroom, our glorious Savior, Jesus, our Lord.
