# When Jesus Will Return

When will Jesus return? It's one of the oldest questions Christians have pondered. Since the earliest days of the church, people have been trying to figure out exactly when the second coming will happen.

And the history of these attempts is not encouraging. Every generation seems to produce a new batch of date-setters who claim to have cracked some biblical code or discovered some pattern in prophecy that reveals exactly when Jesus will come back. In the 1970s we had _The Late Great Planet Earth_. More recently, the _Left Behind_ series. And in between, countless predictions that came and went without incident.

All this computational Christianity has led to some remarkably strange outcomes. There have been people who've sold their houses, quit their jobs, and gathered on hilltops waiting for a rapture that never happened. Others have created elaborate charts and timelines, connecting dots between Bible verses and current events that don't actually connect.

The level of goofiness that has emerged from alleged careful study of end-times prophecy might make you reluctant to even talk about the second coming. It's gotten so weird in some circles that reasonable Christians might be tempted to avoid the topic altogether.

But that would be a mistake. Because the return of Christ isn't some peripheral doctrine we can safely ignore. It's central to Christian hope. Every week when Christians recite the Apostles' Creed, they affirm that Jesus "will come again to judge the living and the dead." So we need to understand what Jesus actually teaches about his return, setting aside all the distractions.

In Matthew 24-25, Jesus gives us his most extended teaching on this subject. And the first thing he tells us is something that all those date-setters have apparently decided to ignore: "But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only."

That's pretty clear, isn't it? No one knows when Jesus will return. Not the angels. Not even Jesus himself during his earthly ministry knew the date of his return. Only the Father knows.

Then Jesus gives us an illustration. He compares his return to what happened in Noah's day. People were just going about their normal lives—"eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage"—right up until the moment when Noah entered the ark and the flood came. They were caught completely by surprise.

What Jesus emphasizes throughout this passage is that his return will have several distinct characteristics:

First, it will be unexpected. No one knows the day. Unlike the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, for which Jesus gave specific signs to watch for, there are no clear warning signs for the second coming. Christ will return when the Father decides it's time, not when our calculations say he should.

Second, it will be sudden, immediate, and final. There won't be a long siege or a gradual process. There won't be a series of warnings like those annoying emails telling you your subscription is about to expire. It will happen instantly: "Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left."

Third, it will involve a division. Some will be taken, others left behind. Some will enter the wedding feast, others will be shut out. Some will be rewarded, others punished. There's a finality to this division that's sobering.

Fourth, it will be universal and visible. Everyone will know what's happening. Jesus says his coming won't be hidden like when he came as a baby in Bethlehem. Rather, "as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man." No one will miss it.

Fifth, it will be personal. The master himself is coming to evaluate each servant. The bridegroom himself decides who enters the wedding feast. Jesus will look each person in the eye and either welcome them or say, "I never knew you."

So Jesus tells his disciples: "Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming." And: "Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."

But what does it mean to "stay awake" and "be ready"? Jesus clarifies this with two parables.

First, he tells about servants left in charge while their master is away. The faithful servant keeps doing what the master assigned him to do—feeding the household at the proper times. When the master returns unexpectedly, he finds the servant doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing. The reward? Greater responsibility: "he will set him over all his possessions."

But the wicked servant says to himself, "My master is delayed," and starts mistreating fellow servants and indulging himself. When the master suddenly returns, this servant faces severe punishment.

The lesson? Being ready doesn't mean sitting around staring at the sky. It means faithfully doing what Jesus has called you to do, whether he returns today or in a thousand years.

Second, Jesus tells about ten virgins waiting for a bridegroom to arrive for a wedding feast. Five brought extra oil for their lamps; five didn't. When the bridegroom was delayed and finally came at midnight, the five who had prepared were able to light their way to the feast. The unprepared ones weren't ready and got shut out, hearing those devastating words: "I do not know you."

This parable adds an important point: You can't borrow readiness from someone else. Each person is responsible for their own spiritual preparation. You can't enter the kingdom because your parents or spouse have faith. You need your own oil.

The message of all these teachings is consistent: Since we don't know when Jesus will return, we need to live each day as if it could be the day. Not in panic or anxiety, but in faithful service and joyful anticipation.

This is exactly how the apostles applied Jesus's teaching in their letters. Paul says: "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." James writes: "Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord... Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand." Peter adds: "The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. Above all, keep loving one another earnestly."

But why the delay? If Jesus could return at any time, why hasn't he come back yet? Peter gives us the answer: "The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."

The delay is because of God's patience and mercy. He's giving more people time to hear the gospel and respond. In fact, if you're a Christian today, there was once a moment before you believed when God in his patience chose not to send Jesus back yet—because he was waiting for you.

The fact that Jesus could return at any moment shouldn't fill us with fear, but with purpose. We don't need elaborate charts or calculations. We just need to be found doing what he's called us to do when he comes—loving God, loving others, and making disciples.

So when will Jesus return? No one knows the day or hour. But we do know this: It will be sudden. It will be visible. It will be final. And it will be exactly when God has planned it to be. Until then, our job is to be ready by faithfully serving our Master, eagerly anticipating his return, and helping others prepare to meet him.
