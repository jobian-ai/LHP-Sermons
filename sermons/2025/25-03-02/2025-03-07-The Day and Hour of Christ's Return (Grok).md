# Living Hope PCA Sermons: Matthew 24:36-25:13 - The Day and Hour of Christ's Return

## Topics Discussed

1\. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ

- Definition: The anticipated return of Jesus Christ to earth to judge the living and the dead, as affirmed in the Apostles' Creed.

- Key Points:

  - Jesus is currently reigning in heaven but will return at an unknown time.

  - Unlike the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD (with signs), the Second Coming has no predictive signs.

  - Emphasized characteristics:

    - Unknown Timing: No one knows the day or hour, only the Father (Matthew 24:36).

    - Sudden and Immediate: It will occur unexpectedly, like a thief in the night or the flood in Noah’s day.

    - Division: A separation between the faithful and the unfaithful, e.g., one taken, one left (Matthew 24:40-41).

    - Universal and Visible: It will be unmistakable, like lightning from east to west, not hidden.

    - Personal: Jesus will judge each individual directly.

2\. Parable of the Faithful and Wicked Servants

- Definition: A story illustrating two types of servants awaiting their master’s return—one faithful, one wicked—highlighting preparedness and accountability.

- Sub-Topics:

  - Faithful Servant:

    - Definition: A servant who diligently performs duties (e.g., feeding the household) with discipline and integrity.

    - Outcome: Rewarded with greater responsibility and blessings.

  - Wicked Servant:

    - Definition: A servant who, assuming delay, becomes self-serving, abusive, and indulgent.

    - Outcome: Judged harshly, “cut in pieces,” and placed with hypocrites in punishment.

- Key Points:

  - Readiness means active faithfulness, not passive waiting.

  - Judgment is personal and final based on one’s actions.

3\. Parable of the Ten Virgins

- Definition: A parable of ten virgins awaiting a bridegroom, split between five wise (prepared with oil) and five foolish (unprepared), symbolizing readiness for Christ’s return.

- Sub-Topics:

  - Wise Virgins:

    - Definition: Those who prepared by bringing extra oil, ensuring they could join the bridegroom.

    - Outcome: Enter the wedding feast.

  - Foolish Virgins:

    - Definition: Those who neglected preparation, lacking oil, and were excluded.

    - Outcome: Locked out, with the bridegroom saying, “I do not know you” (Matthew 25:12).

- Key Points:

  - Personal responsibility is critical; faith cannot be borrowed.

  - Delay tests preparedness, but the arrival is sudden and final.

4\. Christian Response to the Second Coming

- Definition: The call to live faithfully, alertly, and obediently in anticipation of Christ’s return.

- Key Instructions:

  - Be alert and ready, as the timing is unknown (Matthew 24:42-44).

  - Live a life of active service, repentance, and love for Christ.

  - Avoid distractions like date-setting or anxiety, focusing instead on pleasing the Master.

5\. Purpose of the Delay

- Definition: The interval before Christ’s return, attributed to God’s patience for the sake of repentance and salvation.

- Key Points:

  - God delays not from slowness but from mercy, desiring all to repent (2 Peter 3:9).

  - The delay allows the Gospel to spread, reflecting God’s love for humanity.

SUMMARY (166 words)

The lecture explores Jesus’ teaching on His Second Coming from Matthew 24, emphasizing its unknown timing, suddenness, and finality, as no one—not even Jesus or the angels—knows the day, only the Father. Using Noah’s flood, the parable of the servants, and the ten virgins, Jesus illustrates a division between the prepared and unprepared, urging disciples to stay alert and faithful. The faithful servant is rewarded for diligence, while the wicked faces severe judgment. The wise virgins enter the feast, but the foolish are excluded, highlighting personal responsibility. The delay in Christ’s return reflects God’s patience, offering time for repentance. Christians are called to live obediently, repenting quickly, serving actively, and awaiting Christ with joy, not fear, despite the unpredictability. Distractions like date-setting are discouraged, focusing instead on a life pleasing to the Master, who will return visibly and personally to judge all.
