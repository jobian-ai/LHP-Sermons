"Jesus teaches us to give to Caesar what is Caesar's, but more importantly, to give to God what is God's - our hearts, minds, and lives."

"Render unto Caesar his due, but give to God your soul, your heart, your all."

"To Caesar, pay what empire claims, but unto God, surrender heart and soul's eternal flames."

"To Caesar, give what Caesar owns, but to our God, present your heart and bones."
