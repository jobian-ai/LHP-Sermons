# Jesus the Prophet: An Essay on Matthew 23

In Matthew 23, Jesus does something unexpected. He confronts the religious leaders of his time, the Pharisees and scribes, not just as a teacher but as a prophet. And not the kind of prophet people imagine today—a fortune-teller or a sage—but the kind of prophet who exposes hypocrisy and calls people back to truth. The kind who makes enemies.

When people think of Jesus, they often imagine him as a kind healer or a wise teacher. But here, he's something else. He's fierce. He's relentless. He uses words like a sword. In this chapter, Jesus condemns the religious elite with seven "woes," exposing their hypocrisy, arrogance, and blindness. And what makes this even more remarkable is that he does it with sadness, not glee. He takes no pleasure in this confrontation. But he does it anyway because the truth matters more than comfort.

## The Role of a Prophet

Prophets in the Bible were not just people who predicted the future. They were prosecuting attorneys, calling out injustice and hypocrisy. They were uncomfortable people to be around. They disrupted the status quo. They didn’t just speak about God; they spoke for God, indicting those who were religious on the outside but corrupt on the inside. Jesus fits this mold perfectly in Matthew 23.

He stands in the tradition of Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Ezekiel, who condemned false shepherds and exposed the rottenness beneath the surface of religious systems. When Jesus speaks to the Pharisees and scribes, he isn’t just critiquing their behavior. He’s unmasking an entire system of hypocrisy, a system that claimed to honor God but actually kept people away from him.

## The Pharisees: Hypocrisy Unveiled

The Pharisees weren’t cartoon villains. They were respected religious leaders. They knew the Scriptures. They were meticulous in their obedience to the law. But that was the problem. They focused on rules and appearances, missing the heart of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. They loved titles and honors. They loved looking holy. But inside, Jesus says, they were “full of greed and self-indulgence.”

They preached but didn’t practice. They weighed people down with impossible burdens but did nothing to help. They looked good on the outside but were corrupt within. Jesus calls them “whitewashed tombs”—beautiful on the outside, but full of dead men’s bones on the inside.

The harshness of Jesus’ words isn’t about venting anger. It’s about truth. These leaders were leading people away from God while claiming to represent him. That made them dangerous. And Jesus, as a prophet, had to confront that.

## Why Confrontation?

It’s tempting to see this as just another religious argument, like a theological debate between rivals. But Jesus wasn’t trying to win an argument. He was fighting for people’s souls. He saw the damage hypocrisy was doing. He saw people being shut out of the kingdom of God by leaders who were supposed to be the gatekeepers. He saw pride dressed up as piety, and arrogance parading as authority. And he couldn’t let that go unchallenged.

Jesus doesn’t just expose hypocrisy. He shows what true leadership looks like. He tells his disciples not to seek titles like “Rabbi” or “Father” because they only have one teacher—God. True greatness, he says, is found in humility and service, not in power or prestige.

The contrast is striking. The Pharisees loved being exalted. They craved honor. But Jesus says, “Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” This isn’t just a lesson for religious leaders. It’s for everyone who’s tempted by the allure of status and recognition. And that’s all of us, isn’t it?

## The Cost of Hypocrisy

Jesus’ words weren’t just warnings. They were judgments. When he says “woe to you,” he’s not just expressing sadness; he’s declaring disaster. Hypocrisy has consequences. It destroys people from the inside out. It blinds them to truth. It makes them incapable of recognizing God’s presence, even when he’s standing right in front of them.

And that’s the tragedy of the Pharisees. They were the religious experts, but they couldn’t see God in Jesus. They were so consumed with protecting their status and authority that they plotted to kill the very Messiah they claimed to be waiting for.

The danger of hypocrisy is not just that it deceives others. It deceives the hypocrite. It’s a self-imposed blindness that leads to self-destruction.

## A Prophetic Lament

After exposing the Pharisees’ hypocrisy, Jesus does something unexpected. He laments. He weeps over Jerusalem, the city that kills prophets. “How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing.”

This isn’t the voice of an angry judge. It’s the voice of a broken-hearted Savior. He wanted to save them, but they refused. His lament reveals his heart: He didn’t want to condemn them; he wanted to gather them. But they chose pride over repentance.

## What About Us?

It’s easy to read Matthew 23 and judge the Pharisees. But the real question is, what about us? Hypocrisy didn’t die with the Pharisees. It’s alive and well in every generation, including ours.

Do we crave recognition more than we care about truth? Do we care more about looking good than being good? Do we put burdens on others while making excuses for ourselves? Do we refuse to look under the hood of our own lives, afraid of what we might find?

If we’re honest, we’re not that different from the Pharisees. And that’s the point. Jesus’ words weren’t just for them; they’re for us too. They’re a mirror, exposing our own hypocrisy, our own blindness.

## The Way Out

But Jesus doesn’t leave us in despair. The same prophet who pronounced woes also offers a way out: repentance. He doesn’t just condemn; he calls us back. The way to escape hypocrisy isn’t more effort or better performance. It’s humility. It’s acknowledging our blindness and asking for sight. It’s confessing our sins and trusting in his mercy.

Jesus ends with a promise: “You will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’” This is more than a prophecy of his return. It’s an invitation. Even after exposing their hypocrisy, Jesus offers hope. The door to the kingdom is still open for those who humble themselves and call on him.

## Conclusion: The Choice

Matthew 23 is uncomfortable. It should be. Jesus meant it to be. Prophets don’t comfort the comfortable; they shake them awake. They force us to confront what we don’t want to see. They expose our hypocrisy and call us to repentance.

The question isn’t just whether the Pharisees were hypocrites. It’s whether we are. And the answer isn’t just to try harder but to humble ourselves before the one true teacher, father, and king. The choice is ours: to protect our image or to seek the truth, to exalt ourselves or to humble ourselves, to be blind or to ask for sight.

Jesus the prophet still speaks. The question is whether we’re willing to listen.
