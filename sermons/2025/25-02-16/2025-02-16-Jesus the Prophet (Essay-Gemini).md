# The Pharisee in the Mirror

Have you ever met someone who seemed to have it all figured out? Someone who always had the right answer, the perfect solution, the impeccable life? You listen to them talk, and you can't help but feel a little inadequate. Maybe even a little envious.

But then you get to know them better. You see behind the facade. You realize that their perfect life is just that: a facade. Underneath, they're just as flawed as the rest of us. Maybe even more so.

This is the picture Jesus paints of the Pharisees in Matthew 23. They were the religious elite of their day, the experts in God's law. They were admired and respected by the people. But Jesus saw through their act. He saw their hypocrisy, their pride, their self-righteousness.

And he warns us not to be like them.

It's easy to read this passage and think, "Well, I'm not a Pharisee. I don't have a holier-than-thou attitude." But the truth is, we all have a little bit of Pharisee in us. We all have a tendency to judge others, to focus on outward appearances, to be more concerned with being right than being loving.

The Pharisees were obsessed with the minutiae of the law. They tithed their spices, but they neglected the weightier matters of justice, mercy, and faithfulness. They cleaned the outside of the cup, but inside they were full of greed and self-indulgence.

They were like whitewashed tombs, beautiful on the outside but full of dead men's bones on the inside.

Jesus calls them "blind guides," "hypocrites," and "serpents." He pronounces seven woes on them, each one a scathing indictment of their hypocrisy and self-deception.

It's a sobering picture. And it's a warning to us all.

We need to be careful not to fall into the same trap as the Pharisees. We need to be more concerned with our own hearts than with the outward appearances of others. We need to be more concerned with loving God and loving our neighbor than with being right.

The Pharisees were so focused on their own righteousness that they missed the Messiah standing right in front of them. They were so busy judging others that they failed to see their own need for salvation.

Don't let that be us.

Let's be honest with ourselves about our own flaws and shortcomings. Let's be quick to forgive others and slow to judge. Let's be more concerned with being humble and compassionate than with being right.

And let's always remember that the only way to escape the judgment of God is to repent of our sins and put our faith in Jesus Christ. He is the only one who can make us clean on the inside. He is the only one who can give us true righteousness.

So let's not be Pharisees. Let's be followers of Jesus. Let's be people of integrity, sympathy, and humility. Let's be people who are more concerned with loving God and loving others than with being right.

That's the kind of life that truly honors God.
