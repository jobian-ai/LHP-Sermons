# What’s Jesus Worth?

I listened to a sermon the other day, one of those long ones where the preacher walks you through a chunk of the Bible—Matthew 26, in this case—and tries to pull something real out of it. It’s about Jesus heading toward the cross, but the part that stuck with me wasn’t the plot. It was the question underneath it all: What’s Jesus worth to you? The preacher didn’t say it exactly like that at first, but by the end, he was hammering it home. And it’s a good question, because it forces you to think about what you’re actually chasing.

The story starts simple. Jesus is in Jerusalem for Passover, and the crowds are buzzing. Some think he’s the guy to kick out the Romans. Others, like the religious leaders, see him as a problem to squash. He flips tables in the temple, talks about his return someday to judge everyone, and then, in Matthew 26, predicts he’ll be crucified in two days. He’s calm about it, like he’s running the show. Meanwhile, the high priest Caiaphas and his crew are plotting to kill him quietly, after the feast, so the people don’t riot.

Then there’s this scene at Simon’s house. A woman pours expensive ointment on Jesus’ head—think a year’s wages, gone in a moment. The disciples freak out. “Why this waste?” they say. They’re practical. That money could’ve fed the poor, or maybe padded their own budget. Jesus shuts them down. “She’s done a beautiful thing,” he says. “She’s preparing me for burial.” He knows what’s coming, and he sees her act as a sign of his worth. The preacher leaned into this hard—her giving matches who Jesus is, not some cheap gesture.

But Judas? He’s the flip side. He sees the ointment spill and thinks cash, not value. He goes to the chief priests and sells Jesus out for 30 pieces of silver. That’s slave money, the price you’d pay if your ox gored someone’s servant. Judas spent years with Jesus—saw the miracles, heard the teaching—and still pegged him that low. The preacher asked us to look at that. What’s your 30 pieces? Money? Pride? Something else you’d trade Jesus for?

Writing this down makes it sharper than just hearing it. The sermon’s point isn’t complicated, but it’s tricky to pin down in your head until you wrestle with it. Jesus is either everything or nothing. The woman got that. Judas didn’t. The disciples were somewhere in between, mouthing the right words—“You’re the Messiah”—but balking when it cost something real. I’ve been there. You say one thing, but your choices say another. Putting it into words shows the gap.

The preacher tied it to Passover too. It used to mean God freeing the Jews from Egypt. Jesus flips it—his death becomes the new redemption, the cross trumping everything before it. He’s in control, walking into the trap willingly, because that’s the plan. Caiaphas thinks he’s winning, but he’s just a pawn. Same with Judas. The sermon says that’s how it always goes—powerful people plot, but Jesus runs the show.

There’s a bit about his return too. Sudden, visible, dividing who’s in and who’s out. What you do now matters then, especially how you treat people. It’s not abstract. It’s about what you value today. The preacher quoted a hymn—“Jesus, priceless treasure”—and asked if we’d say that. Not just sing it, but live it. I liked that. It’s easy to nod along, harder to check your own math.

Here’s what I learned writing this: you don’t really know what you think Jesus is worth until you look at what you’re giving up for him. The woman gave a fortune. Judas gave him up for pocket change. The disciples grumbled about losing anything. Me? I’m still figuring it out. Probably you are too. That’s the test— not what you say, but what you do when it’s your ointment on the table.

The sermon’s not perfect. It rambles some, and the Holiday Inn bit felt forced. But the core hits. Jesus says he’s worth it all, and he proves it by going to the cross. The question bounces back: Do you? I can’t answer that for you. I’m still editing my own answer, and it’s messy. But that’s why I wrote this—to see it clearer. You should try it too. What’s he worth to you? Write it down. You’ll find out something you didn’t expect.
