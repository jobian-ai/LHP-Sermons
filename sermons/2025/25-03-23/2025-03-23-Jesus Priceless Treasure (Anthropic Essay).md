# Jesus, Priceless Treasure

What's the most valuable thing in your life?

I was struck by this question while reading through the passage for today's sermon from Matthew 26. In this text, we find a stark contrast between how different people valued Jesus.

The scene opens with Jesus telling his disciples something remarkable: "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified." Just days before, this same Jesus had been describing his future return in glory, sitting on a throne and judging the world. Now he's calmly announcing his imminent death.

Meanwhile, in the palace of Caiaphas the high priest, the religious leaders are plotting. They want to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him, but they're afraid of the crowds. "Not during the feast," they say, "lest there be an uproar among the people." They see Jesus as a problem to be eliminated when it's politically convenient.

Then the scene shifts to a house in Bethany. Jesus is having dinner at the home of Simon the leper (probably someone Jesus had healed), when a woman approaches him with an alabaster flask containing extremely expensive ointment. Without hesitation, she pours it on Jesus's head.

The disciples are indignant. "Why this waste?" they ask. "This could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor." In Mark's account, we learn they estimated its value at a year's wages. Imagine someone pouring out something worth $50,000 or $100,000 in a single gesture.

Jesus defends her: "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me." Then he adds that she has anointed him for burial, connecting this act to his earlier prediction of his crucifixion.

Finally, we see Judas Iscariot going to the chief priests, asking "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" They agree on thirty pieces of silver—the price of a slave in Old Testament law.

What strikes me most about this passage is how differently people valued Jesus:

1. The unnamed woman valued Jesus so highly that she poured out her most precious possession on him without hesitation.

2. The disciples, while following Jesus, thought this extravagant gift was a waste.

3. The religious leaders valued getting rid of Jesus more than hearing his message.

4. Judas valued thirty pieces of silver more than his relationship with Jesus.

This passage forces us to ask ourselves: what do we think Jesus is worth?

The woman's act of devotion stands in stark contrast to everyone else in the story. We don't even know her name, yet Jesus says, "Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her." She remains anonymous, yet immortalized.

What made her act so remarkable? It wasn't just the financial value of what she gave, but the fact that she gave it without calculation or reservation. She didn't pour out half the flask and save some for later. She didn't worry about what others would think. She simply valued Jesus above everything else.

The disciples' reaction is particularly telling. These were men who had followed Jesus for years, who had seen his miracles, heard his teaching, and even called him the Messiah. Yet when they saw this extravagant display of devotion, they called it a "waste."

I wonder how often I do the same thing. I might say Jesus is important to me, but my actions reveal a different set of priorities.

Think about what you value most in your life. You can usually tell by looking at three things:

1. Where you spend your money
2. Where you spend your time
3. What you think about when your mind is free to wander

By these measures, what do you truly value? Is Jesus your "priceless treasure," as Johann Franck's hymn declares, or is he just one priority among many?

Judas presents the most disturbing case study in misplaced values. He had been with Jesus throughout his ministry. He had seen the healings, the miracles, the transformed lives. Yet in the end, he valued thirty pieces of silver more than Jesus himself.

What's remarkable is that Jesus knew all this was coming. He wasn't caught by surprise. He willingly walked toward the cross, knowing that one of his closest companions would betray him, that the religious leaders would condemn him, and that the crowds who had welcomed him with "Hosanna!" would soon shout "Crucify him!"

And why did he do this? Because he valued us.

This is the great reversal at the heart of the gospel. We struggle to value Jesus appropriately, yet he valued us enough to die for us. As Paul writes in Romans 5:8, "God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

When we see how Jesus valued us enough to go to the cross, it changes how we value him. That's why the woman's act of pouring out the expensive ointment makes perfect sense. She understood, perhaps better than the disciples, what Jesus was about to do.

When our hearts grasp this reality, our response will be like that woman's—extravagant devotion that others might call wasteful.

The early Christians understood this. They didn't see their possessions, their time, or even their lives as their own. They had found something—someone—of such surpassing value that everything else became secondary.

This is why Jesus said, "Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it." When we truly value Jesus above everything else, we discover that we've lost nothing worth keeping and gained everything worth having.

So what will you do? When Jesus exposes the things you value more than him—whether it's money, comfort, reputation, or anything else—how will you respond?

Will you reject him like Judas and the religious leaders, who couldn't bear the thought of surrendering their priorities? Or will you respond in repentance and faith, letting go of whatever competes with Jesus for your heart's affection?

As Johann Franck put it in his hymn:

> Jesus, priceless treasure,  
> Found of purest pleasure,  
> You're the truest friend to me.  
> In Your arms, I rest me.  
> Foes who would molest me  
> Cannot reach me.

We chase after so many things, thinking they'll bring us happiness. But there is only one true source of lasting joy, and that's the one who valued us enough to go to the cross.

May we value Jesus above everything else, extravagantly giving of all we have received, being salt and light in this world, and pointing others to Jesus, our priceless treasure, our Lord, and our King.
