# LHCP Sermon - Jesus Priceless Treasure

If you're uh visiting with us today we have been walking as a congregation uh through the gospel of matthew and it's the story of jesus uh his words and his works uh and the first two thirds of this book uh describe for us the beginnings of his ministry and then the teaching and healing and miracles that he performed uh over the course of three years in and around the sea of galilee uh here is jesus doing all of these wonderful marvelous things and uh here are his disciples uh learning growing in their faith and here are the crowds marveling at his teaching bringing people to him to be healed there was some opposition uh he would have to interact with but for the most part uh the central action of his ministry wasn't so much dealing with his opponents as teaching about the kingdom of god and what kind of king uh he would be the delight and the wonder of that beginning of his ministry contained in the first twothirds of the book gives way however to the final week of his ministry um as jesus heads to the cross this um uh this last week of his life is contained in the final onethird of matthew's gospel jesus has come into jerusalem at this point in the story uh he was traveling there to celebrate the passover feast the jewish feast of passover alongside a large group of people uh the disciples and their families would have been with them others from the galilean region the crowds and and news of his coming had stirred up at least some of the city uh crowds line the streets and they shout as jesus enters in you know hosana uh to the to the son of david blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord people praise him and and some wonder is is this the one who's going to come is this the messiah the christ that is going to come and kick out the the roman occupiers is this the one his entry into the crowded city also drew the attention of the chief priests and the sadducees uh and the pharisees who were always on the watch for those who might stir up some trouble um with the romans and so cause trouble not only for the jews but uh for uh these political or religious leaders themselves and as we go on in matthew opposition to jesus just becomes more pronounced the uh religious establishment and the political establishment are on high alert and then here he comes into the temple and he does all these sort of disruptive actions turns these tables over uh and then begins this kind of communication back and forth where he asserts his authority as king over and against the authority of these religious leaders uh and it's deepening their animosity towards him jesus leaves jerusalem he's staying outside of there as they prepare for the feast and he leaves after these temple confrontations and he has a private conversation with his disciples uh and this is what we've been looking at for the last several weeks um speaking of the destruction of the temple and jerusalem which occurred in 70 ad and then of his of his own second coming coming his return at the end of the age uh to judge the living and the dead as we say in the apostles creed and we saw jesus emphasizing that this second coming uh would be sudden that no one would know the day or the hour that it would be visible that there would be no mistaking it that it would be personal that we will all see jesus when he comes and that it will be a time of division that there will be those who will be welcomed into the kingdom of god and those who will be cast out and that there that what we do with the life that we've been given and how we treat others particularly those of the household of faith uh matters today we begin in matthew 26 the last section of the gospel the private conversation has ended and jesus brings the disciples down from thinking about the future uh to to write them the present and the plot and the story begins to thicken the cross is quite near so hear the word of the lord this morning from matthew 26 when jesus had finished all these sayings he said to his disciples "you know that after two days uh the passover is coming and the son of man will be delivered up to be crucified." then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest whose name was caiaphas and plotted together in order to arrest jesus by stealth and kill him but they said "not during the feast lest there be an uproar among the people." now when jesus was at bethany in the house of simon the leper a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask a very expensive ointment and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table and when the disciples saw it they were indignant saying "why this waste for this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor." but jesus aware of this said to them "why do you trouble the woman for she has done a beautiful thing to me you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me." in pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial truly i say to you wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will also be told in memory of her then one of the twel whose name was judas a scariot went to the chief priests and said "what will you give me if i deliver him over to you?" and they paid him 30 pieces of silver and from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him uh this is the word of the lord this morning our passage begins with jesus making a declaration uh and and it's this he says you know you know that uh two days uh in two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be delivered up uh to be crucified the passover is coming soon it was the meal that would begin the week-long festival in uh in jerusalem that celebrated god's redemption of his people was a f a festival that celebrated that they belonged to god that they were his people and the passover would take on a greater meaning very soon uh redemption and identification as god's people would become connected with this historical event that jesus is talking about that the son of man would be delivered up to be crucified in other words it would not be long before the redemption of the people of god would be associated with the cross of christ uh instead of um the deliverance from slavery in in egypt this is by the way the same son of man who had just been telling the disciples that he would be coming in glory with all of his angels and that he would be sitting on a glorious throne judging everyone this conversation had just ended where he said this and now he turns his attention their attention to this you know after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be delivered up and crucified it's not the first time that he uh has said um any said this and the disciples response to it isn't um isn't recorded for us here but you get the impression from other places that the disciples kind of they liked the talk about jesus and the throne and this talk they did not like they kind of maybe hoped that it would go away so we don't have any indication how the disciples responded to once again jesus telling them "i'm going to the cross i'm going to be delivered up." it's important to see too that jesus knowing this that he is accepting all of it willingly uh he's not running from what he knows uh must occur for him to accomplish the purposes for which he came so he's willingly going uh to be delivered up and then crucified he's not running from it at all walking right into it he knows what he's doing he's running it running the show uh it's clear that he's in control here he's naming the time when all of this is going to take place has to take place at passover so that this connection of redemption and gets gets drawn so we go from this little uh conversation jesus has as he finishes up with the disciples to a different location meanwhile in a in a palace in jerusalem there are some powerful men and uh and they're plotting um the palace belonged to the high priest at the time a man by the name of caiaphas uh caiaphas had been appointed as the high priests were at that time by the secular authorities um the herod folk and then they had to get pass muster or get approved by the roman authorities uh as well who were the occupiers so this position uh was one of great power um but it was also one that that historically was very hard to keep most of the time the high priest did not last very long uh because you had to be uh so politically savvy that you were able to handle the fact um that you had to keep everybody happy it didn't take much to get yourself kicked out of the position caiaphas uh was was was politically savvy he he held this post um the longest of any he held it for 18 years he was the high priest in jerusalem and in this palace the chief priests and the elders of the people they're gathering and they're gathering just to talk and to plot about the way um how they might destroy jesus that's their objective they would like to destroy jesus jesus is a problem uh and they wanted to know they were you know considering how can we go about doing it and the the first thing they conclude is that we've got to do it by stealth it's got to be secret um jesus is entirely too popular with regular people uh to do it in the middle of the day during the feast might cause an uproar might bring the roman authorities the weight of the roman military down on the people and then they thought to and in addition we'll do it by stealth uh so that no one really knows about it and then we'll also do it after this feast is over um people will probably have other things on their mind you know it's like the last day of your vacation you know the last day of the vacation is rarely a vacation is it it's like because you're thinking about what you got to do to get back to your regular life so that so they're they're saying well if we wait till way at the end everybody's mind's going to be in another place any kind of messiah expectation will be sort of gone um and maybe their commitment to their way of life you know they'll have done the passover festivities and everybody will be excited about being jewish again and you know heading heading home and it just won't be a problem we'll just eliminate them get them out of the way so that was their plan of course nothing happened according to what they plotted because jesus is in control of all of this but their plan was to wait till everybody was sort of gone and it was sort of quiet um we know that uh that that wasn't how things worked out you know there are always going to be plots happening in the palaces of this world uh against god and his people um often these are going to concern christians directly to accomplish the uh purposes of the powerful over time uh christians as a group are often are either courted you know try to make them feel important so they'll be on your side um or dealt with harshly uh try to get them to shut up by by eliminating them this fact that christians will often feel the brunt of the plotting that goes on in places of power is why peter would later write that we should never be surprised and yet we still managed to be surprised but we should never be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you as though something strange were happening to you it's it's why jesus would say himself in this world you're going to have tribulation but take heart i have overcome the world all times all purposes are in god's hands he's he's ruling over everything when troubles come they're not to be met with a surprise like why or how did this happen but with looking to christ in faith taking heart knowing that he has a purpose in our troubles and that we can trust him as our king and although in our own nation christians may not currently be feeling the weight of opposition uh that comes uh from those who are powerful we must not believe that this will always be the case and begin to slowly shift our trust to our government who likes us today and hates us tomorrow versus in god who redeemed us in christ is committed to us always and calls us his own this is the scene it's caiaphas the place of power there's the plotting that goes on and then the scene shifts from that palace to the house of a man named simon the leper it's not a palace not a glorious place at all it's someone's home where jesus and his disciples are having a meal uh it's the house of a man by the name of simon um he would not have been hosting the meal if he was currently dealing with leprosy that wouldn't have been allowed and so this was likely a man who was known as simon the leper and they probably just didn't call him simon the ex- leper it's very likely that jesus had healed him of his leprosy and now jesus and his disciples are there and in this house uh was a woman and we are not given her name very different the the the sort of the the centerpiece the the most faithful disciple of all that we hear of in this story the most faithful person we have no idea what her name is uh matthew doesn't give it to us here's caiaphas and all of his pomp and arrogance we know his name and of course we're going to know judas's name but here is this woman and um and she has a uh a flask of some very expensive ointment we're told and she is jesus is there at the meal and she pours it on his head now um that might seem odd to us today i've been to some of your houses and you've never poured anything on my head uh and uh and i h hopefully haven't poured anything on yours um but in the day it would have been sort of a common act of hospitality should someone of importance come into your home that there would be like this this ceremony or this practice of uh pouring some ointment on the person's head it showed that they were important now i know personally how important i am because i'm a member of um the holiday and express club and i currently am uh am platinum elite okay so there's there's silver elite and then there's gold elite and then there's platinum elite and i'm at this status and with this status you may be interested in knowing um comes uh every time i go to a holiday express they thank me one for my importance and then they say "would you like a free bottle of water?" and i of course i sure that's fine and then if and rarely there is one available but occasionally there's been available a room upgrade so you can do this so i've you know sort of really worked this you know a lot with my children when they were young about how important i was being platinum elite uh lately they have decided to invent a status that i have not yet made it to it's called the diamond elite status and uh and in this status not only do you get your bottle of water and potential free room upgrade but you also get parking close to the entrance a parking space that has a like sign that says diamond elite member so everybody knows these these grand names right with these like little pieces of hospitality little expressions of hospitality i mean the expressions of hospitality do not match the name that they are giving you here is here's jesus he is he's the king of kings he's the messiah the christ the son of god and this woman pours onto his head an ointment and in this act actually matches the gift to the name of the person who's receiving the gift we're told that the ointment is expensive in mark's gospel account of this story we're actually given a little bit more information uh that the disciples thought that they could have gotten for it the sum of um a year's worth of wages so think about what you make in a year i mean the best of the best and and she took it and she put it on his head the woman is is valuing jesus highly she may be anointing him in her own mind as like "okay this is the king and i'm going to do that." or or maybe it's just an extravagant gift of of love for her lord you know maybe u maybe he had healed her of something and she was just responding back out of great love we're not told what's in her mind but we are told about the disciples reaction it says that they are indignant and that they're pragmatic why this waste it might be rephrased why are you allowing her to waste this expensive ointment on you i mean there's money that could be given to the poor and maybe they were thinking in their own minds you know the budget's a little bit low maybe that group could have a little bit better food next time that we're out we could set a little aside for us jesus says "why do you trouble the woman she's done a beautiful thing to me you always have the poor with you but you won't always have me." but then he asks adds that this is an appropriate action not simply because of the value that the woman is placing on jesus but but also because of what it's actually doing he says you know she's anointing me for my burial like he knows because attention is being brought back to this earlier statement he had made about being delivered up and being crucified jesus's mind is on the cross he knows his death is going to be very near he's not going to be anointed when he's hanging up there naked on a cross to die brutally tortured by the romans the contrast between the brutality which he was about to experience in two days which he knew and the beauty of this woman valuing him so highly pouring a beautiful gift on his head it's clearly something that's before his eyes and his mind and so jesus says "this precious beautiful gift of this woman will be talked about every time the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world an unnamed woman's act is to be proclaimed in darlington because it's precious it's a beautiful gift what do you value this morning i mean note how extravagant this gift is to jesus no wonder the call to of the bible is always to like generosity towards sacrificial giving uh when we give for the glory of god out of a genuine love for him what a what a beautiful thing the disciples devalued jesus they spoke of him they saw him and they spoke of him uh as messiah right peter's confession you are the christ the son of the living god they spoke of him that way they spoke of them as your platinum elite diamond elite you're worth at least some mediocre ointment you're worth us hanging with you but it's hard to get past the truth that in the end they thought anointing jesus was a waste i wonder if they were getting anointed in this way by the woman whether they would have thought the same thing what do you value this morning what do you think jesus is worth do you see your material goods um as given to you for the service of god and others or do you see god and others as here to give you a better life to provide you with what you need to live for you the gospel is always calling us away from self and towards seeking first the kingdom of god and his righteousness in everything uh and towards an extravagance of giving that demonstrates that we love jesus above everything else now there was there was one man there who saw all this and he had just simply had enough and uh and we're invited by matthew to get a small look into into his heart the man whose name was uh judas a scariot judas we know from other passages uh that speak about him was a thief the the scriptures say that um he used to take money from the group's money box their what they had together to to uh to to live on or to travel on and he also appears um i guess maybe because he liked money a lot to have served as the treasurer of the group of disciples uh of course it's not an uncommon occurrence in our day to occasionally hear of someone who has access to funds uh pilfering from the funds to get some advantage to themselves this was judas it's possible that he saw here a a bit of a windfall slipping through his fingers as he watched that anoint ointment being poured on jesus's head in another account of this story in the gospel it is judas who we don't normally hear from it's judas who's leading the charge and saying "what a waste what a waste." judas was a thief judas was also an idoltor the scripture says very clearly that we cannot serve god and money judas served money maybe he didn't want to be this way maybe he felt bad i mean we know he did eventually but maybe he felt guilty about the stealing and maybe it's why you join the disciples he thought like i'll join these guys i'll try to get a little spirituality in my life i'll try to do better seems like jesus has some good things to say we just don't know but here's what we know we know that judas hated the valuation that the woman had made of jesus and that je judas valued him at a much lower price because judas loved money he was an idoltor and judas was the betrayer so here's this man and he had he had followed jesus i mean you know he had followed jesus through his whole entire ministry he had seen jesus healing people he had been in the boat when jesus had calmed the storm he had heard every message that jesus had to proclaim publicly about the kingdom of god he knew from the private conversation that jesus says "i am going to be the one who is the judge of the living and the dead of all people." maybe the talk of crucifixion and death had scared judas a little but when he saw this he decided "i can't follow him any longer so he goes to the chief priests and he asks for money in exchange for delivering jesus over to them uh basically he's saying "how much will you pay me to be an informant i'll give you um i'll let you know his movements." and the price they agree on is 30 pieces of silver that's important um in the old testament there was a rule and here was the rule it actually concerned oxen okay and the rule was this that if you owned oxen you needed to keep them under control basically we might say you know you got to keep them fenced in so that they sort of stay under control you can't have them running wild but if an ox did go wild and gored somebody and killed them you like owed the person's family who they who was killed the owner of the ox had to pay up if it was a slave who was gourded the price of payment for the slave was 30 pieces of silver it was a slave price that was what the chief priests were willing to pay and what judas was willing to accept they valued jesus as no more than the price of a common slave they believed jesus wasn't worth much that jesus was a waste and the scripture says "and from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him." you know we can ask ourselves what what do we want do we want jesus do we want money jesus's entire ministry his words and his deeds were kind of a continuous exposure you can see this in the bible is like a continuous exposure of the sinful hearts of people they're just laid out there and he continues to do that with us today uh he brings about events in our lives or he speaks in his word in such a way um that uh that that we begin to see that there are things in our lives that maybe we value more than jesus himself we would maybe say jesus is platinum elite but our actions might indicate otherwise what are these things well it might be money or it might be our spouse or it might be our idea of family or our possessions or our pride or just our self some of those things aren't necessarily bad in and of themselves money isn't bad it just can't be the master the master is the master and our money is given to us to let us serve him well but when our hearts are exposed which they are as as people by events and by god's word we are by god's grace enable to see the things that we value more highly than jesus and it's at that point that the most important thing happens and that is that when confronted we we react judas and the religious leaders they are confronted by the person of jesus jesus exposes what they are he allows things to happen so they can see judas becomes very well aware that he just traded out the price for 30 pieces of silver he feels guilty what do people do well judas and the religious leaders when confronted they reject jesus they betray him they ultimately strive to just get rid of him because they don't want to think about that anymore but there's other men in the bible in contrast a man like zakius which we read about other elsewhere or saul of tarsus they did they did awful things they they stole from people they they killed christians but when jesus appears and shows them and exposes their hearts they respond not with rejection and trying to get rid of them but with repentance and faith so what will it be for you when the lord exposes in you that show you that maybe you value this or that too highly and that you value the lord too lightly will you hear the rebuke will you respond in repentance and faith the disciples learned they did learn they learned to value jesus more than their own lives by the end that's where they were they weren't there here we can see from the text today that they weren't there yet and it took them a while to get there but repentance and faith were the way they are always not rejection and betrayal and pride the disciples ultimately were repentant they trusted christ they followed him and they learn to value him more than their own lives the powerful rulers of this world and many who hear the gospel but don't believe will always be kicking against um the christ so so what will you do what value will you put on jesus this morning jesus has counted you of great value he went to the cross to pay the penalty of your sin that you might be reconciled to god that you might have eternal life that you might receive every spiritual blessing he has poured out his spirit upon your head upon you who is infinitely of greater value than any ointment that ever was poured on anyone so what will you say about him i love this song it's by an old guy a german poet and hymnwriter by the name of johan franc and he says this it's a hymn called jesus christless treasure i would want this to be our declaration he says "jesus priceless treasure found of purest pleasure you're the truest friend to me in your arms i i rest me foes who would molest me cannot reach me though the earth is shaking and every heart would be quaking jesus calms my fear lightnings flash thunders crash yet even though sin and hell assail me jesus will not fail me so depart all fear and sadness for the lord of gladness jesus he enters in those who love the father though the storms may gather still have peace within so whatever i hear must bear thou art still my purest pleasure jesus priceless treasure is christ your priceless treasure are you done chasing the treasures held out to you by this world thinking that there is some life out there without christ at the very center that will make you happy there is one source of happiness and joy in this world and that is the one who went to the cross as he said he would died for us that we might live that we might have peace with god may we extravagantly give of all we have received from the hand of god that we might be salt and light in this world pointing all people everywhere to jesus our priceless treasure our lord and our king let's pray
