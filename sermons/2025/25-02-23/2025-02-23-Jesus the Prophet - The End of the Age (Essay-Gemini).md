## The End of the Age

We don't like to think about endings. It's much more fun to think about beginnings. Most people would rather think about how they're going to improve their lives than about the fact that they're going to die.

But there are endings we have to think about whether we want to or not. If you're building a house, you have to think about the roof, even though that's the last thing you'll build. And everyone who's not immortal has to think about death, even though that's the last thing they'll do.

There are also endings we have to think about because other people are talking about them. If you grew up during the Cold War, you probably remember worrying about nuclear annihilation. And if you've spent any time among Christians, you've probably heard them talk about the Second Coming.

In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus gives a long speech about the end of the world. You have to pay attention to what Jesus says. He was a smart guy. Even now, most people are still figuring out what he meant.

The disciples come up to Jesus and admire the Temple. Jesus responds by saying that not one stone will be left upon another. That's a strong statement. You have to wonder what they thought about that.

Then, when Jesus is sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples ask him when these things will be. And what will be the sign of his coming and the end of the age? They really want to know. It's an important question.

Jesus answers them by talking about all sorts of bad things. There will be false Christs and false prophets. There will be wars and rumors of wars. There will be famines and earthquakes. And then, there will be tribulation, and Christians will be hated by all nations.  

It sounds pretty bad. And that's just the beginning.

Jesus also says that the Temple will be destroyed. This happened in 70 AD. The Romans sacked Jerusalem and burned the Temple to the ground. You might think this was the end of the world, but it wasn't.  

Jesus talks about a second focal point, which is the Second Coming. This is when Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead. No one knows when this will happen.  

In the meantime, Jesus says, Christians should watch for signs. They should learn from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. Likewise, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates.

Christians should also endure to the end. This is not going to be easy. There will be tribulation. There will be persecution. But Jesus promises that he will be with his people to the end of the age.  

What does this all mean for us? It means that we should be watching for the signs of the times. We should be enduring to the end. And we should be living our lives in a way that honors God.

We should also remember that the end is not just about destruction. It's also about new beginnings. The kingdom of Christ will be established, and the gospel will be proclaimed to all nations.

This is good news. It means that even though things may look bad now, there is hope for the future. And that hope is found in Jesus Christ.
