SUMMARY (171 words)

In Matthew 24, Jesus, as prophet and king, addresses the disciples’ questions about the temple’s destruction and the end of the age. Reflecting on death’s inevitability, he predicts the temple’s fall (fulfilled in 70 AD) and describes signs—false messiahs, wars, disasters, persecution, and the "abomination of desolation"—as birth pains of a new era. These events transition from the old covenant to Christ’s eternal kingdom, which begins with his reign and culminates in his Second Coming. Prophecy, neither vague nor overly precise, urges action: believers must watch, endure, pray, and proclaim the gospel amidst tribulation. The sermon ties personal mortality to cosmic redemption, emphasizing Christ’s current kingship and future return to judge all. Christians today are called to live faithfully in a fallen world, awaiting final redemption.
