# The Last Supper

Most people think of meals as simple gatherings for nourishment and conversation. But some meals change history. There's a meal described in Matthew 26 that has shaped the world for two thousand years, and continues to shape it today.

I want to look at this meal – the Last Supper – and consider what happened there. The story appears within a larger narrative that has been building throughout Matthew's gospel. For two-thirds of the book, we've followed Jesus through his ministry around Galilee – teaching, healing, performing miracles. We've watched disciples struggle to understand him, crowds marvel at him, and religious leaders grow suspicious of him.

Then comes that final week of Jesus' life. He enters Jerusalem to shouts of "Hosanna to the Son of David!" The religious authorities grow increasingly hostile. Jesus confronts them in the temple, then speaks privately to his disciples about future events – the destruction of Jerusalem and his eventual return to judge the world.

Now in Matthew 26, we reach the climax. Jesus gathers with his disciples for Passover, one of the most significant Jewish feasts. What happens at this meal reveals something profound about who Jesus is and what he came to do.

## The Setting

The disciples ask a practical question: "Where will You have us prepare for You to eat the Passover?" Jesus sends them to "a certain man" with the message: "The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples."

Notice that Jesus isn't surprised by events. He knows exactly what he's doing. He knows the cross is approaching – within 24 hours he'll be hanging on it. When he says "My time is at hand," he's referring to something very specific, even if the disciples don't fully grasp it yet.

Passover was a joyful celebration, commemorating Israel's deliverance from slavery in Egypt. The disciples are likely anticipating a happy feast. After all, Jesus had just entered Jerusalem to acclaim. Perhaps this would be the moment when he'd finally assert his kingship in the way they expected.

Instead, the meal takes an unexpected turn.

## The Betrayal

In the middle of what should be a celebratory feast, Jesus drops a bombshell: "Truly I say to you, one of you will betray Me."

Imagine being at Thanksgiving dinner and hearing something like this. The mood shifts instantly. The disciples become "very sorrowful" and begin asking, one by one, "Is it I, Lord?"

Jesus' response is deliberately ambiguous: "He who has dipped his hand in the dish with Me will betray Me." They'd all been dipping bread in the communal dish. He adds: "The Son of Man goes as it is written of Him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."

Then Judas speaks up: "Is it I, Rabbi?" Notice he says "Rabbi" (teacher), not "Lord" like the others. Jesus answers, "You have said so."

This is the critical moment in the story – and it mirrors a critical moment in all our lives. When confronted with our own sin, how do we respond? When King David was confronted by the prophet Nathan about his sin with Bathsheba, he said, "I have sinned against the Lord." When Peter preached to the crowds after Jesus' resurrection and they realized their complicity in his death, they were "cut to the heart" and asked, "What must we do to be saved?"

The distinguishing mark of a Christian isn't the absence of sin – we're all sinners. It's what we do when confronted with our sin. Do we try to hide it, blame someone else, or minimize it? Or do we plainly acknowledge, "It is I, I did it"?

Judas doesn't confess. He isn't cut to the heart. Instead, he soon leaves to finalize his betrayal.

## The New Covenant

With this backdrop of betrayal, Jesus does something extraordinary. He takes bread, blesses it, breaks it, and gives it to his disciples with the words, "Take, eat; this is My body." Then he takes a cup of wine, gives thanks, and says, "Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."

What would become a regular part of Christian worship for the next two thousand years began in this moment. And it began with Jesus himself – not with the church, not with the apostles, but with Jesus directly.

Consider what Jesus is saying. First, he's saying that through his body and blood, there will be "forgiveness of sins." The forgiveness he offers isn't cheap – it costs his life.

Second, he calls it "My blood of the covenant." Covenants in the Bible are solemn, binding agreements between God and his people. Jesus is establishing a new covenant community, defined not by national identity but by faith in him.

There's something profound here about identity. We're obsessed with identity today – personality types, political affiliations, cultural backgrounds. We label ourselves and others constantly. But Jesus suggests that only one identity ultimately matters: whether you belong to him. Are you united to Christ through faith? That's the question that transcends all others.

Third, Jesus says his blood is "poured out for many" – not for everyone universally, but for those who will believe in him. The redemption accomplished at the cross is effective for a specific group: those who trust in Jesus.

Finally, Jesus makes a promise: "I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom." This points forward to the consummation of all things when Jesus returns.

## The Meal Today

When we celebrate communion today, we're participating in something Jesus himself instituted. And what Jesus began is greater than the Passover it replaces:

- Passover celebrated deliverance from slavery in Egypt; communion celebrates deliverance from sin itself.
- Passover required the sacrifice of a lamb; communion commemorates the sacrifice of the Son of God.
- Passover was for the Jewish people who could come to Jerusalem; communion is for believers from all nations in all times.

The apostle Paul tells us we are to continue celebrating this meal "until he comes" (1 Corinthians 11:26). It's a reminder that history is moving toward a conclusion. One day, Jesus will return. The kingdom will be fully established. And believers will see sin, sorrow, pain, and death finally defeated.

When that day comes, there will be another meal – what Revelation calls "the marriage supper of the Lamb." People from every nation will gather around Christ's table. The bread of life will be shared, the wine of joy will flow, and the blessings will never end.

Every time we take communion, we're not just looking back to the cross. We're also looking forward to that day.

In the meantime, we face a choice similar to the one faced by those at the original Last Supper. When confronted with our own sin and failures, will we be like Judas, who walked away? Or will we confess, repent, and cling to the one who gave his body and blood for our forgiveness?

That's the invitation of the Last Supper – not just to witness a historical event, but to participate in the redemption it offers. Not just to admire Jesus from a distance, but to receive him as Lord and Savior. Not just to eat bread and drink wine as a religious ritual, but to be united with Christ himself through faith.
