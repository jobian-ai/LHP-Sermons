# The Last Supper

I’ve been thinking about the Last Supper lately, the one in Matthew 26. It’s a simple scene—Jesus eating with his disciples, Passover night, hours before the cross. But it’s not simple at all. It’s heavy, layered, and strange. I heard a sermon about it, and it made me realize how much is going on in that one meal.

Jesus had spent three years teaching and healing around Galilee. People flocked to him, disciples stumbled after him, religious leaders squinted at him. He wasn’t what they expected. They wanted a king to smash the Romans. He talked about a different kingdom. By the time he rides into Jerusalem, the crowd’s shouting “Hosanna,” but the leaders are plotting. He knows it’s coming. He’s not surprised.

The supper starts normal. Passover’s a big deal—lamb, bread, wine, a happy memory of God freeing Israel from Egypt. The disciples ask where to set it up. Jesus says go to some guy’s house. They’re ready for a good night. Then he says, “One of you will betray me.” It’s a punch. They’re shaken, asking, “Is it me?” Judas chimes in, cool as ever. Jesus knows it’s him. “You’ve said so.” Calm, but sharp.

Then it gets weirder. He takes bread, breaks it, says, “This is my body.” Takes wine, says, “This is my blood, poured out for many for forgiveness.” The disciples don’t get it. How could they? It’s the Lord’s Supper now, but back then it’s just cryptic. He’s pointing to the cross, hours away, and a promise that stretches forever.

What hits me is how deliberate he is. Judas, the betrayal, the death—he’s not caught off guard. He’s steering it. Passover was about escaping Egypt. He makes it about escaping sin. The lamb’s gone; he’s the sacrifice now. It’s not just for Israel anymore—it’s for anyone who takes the bread and wine. That’s a big jump.

Judas doesn’t see it. He’s already cashed out Jesus for a few coins. When Jesus calls him out, he doesn’t flinch. No “I did it.” He slips off to the priests instead. The sermon asked: what’s Jesus worth to you? Judas went low. We’re not much different. The disciples bailed too—denied him, hid. We’d do the same. The difference is what happens next. David, caught by Nathan, said, “It’s me.” Judas didn’t. That’s the fork in the road.

The bread and wine stick with me. They’re not just symbols. They’re a deal—forgiveness, cost him everything. And a promise: he’ll drink with us again someday, when he’s back. It’s not abstract. It’s personal. The sermon said the only label that matters is “Christian.” Not your Enneagram or whatever. Just: do you belong to him? That’s it.

It’s a quiet story, but it’s loud if you listen. Jesus knew the plan—his death, his return. Judas missed it. The disciples barely caught it. I wonder what we miss when we’re not paying attention.
