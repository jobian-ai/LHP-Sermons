You can turn with me this morning to Matthew, chapter 26. We've been walking as a congregation through this book, this gospel. It's the story of Jesus, his works and his words. And the first 2/3 of the book have described for us his ministry of teaching and healing and miracles. Over a period of three years in and around the Sea of Galilee. We see Jesus doing all of these wonderful things. Teaching about the kingdom of God, teaching about what kind of king he's going to be, showing what kind of king he is going to be. We've seen the disciples struggling to understand this man who they are affirming as the Christ and yet having to grow deeply in their own faith. We've seen the crowds marveling at his teaching, wondering who he is, who is this guy, bringing people from miles around to be healed by him. And we've seen the local religious leaders concerned a wary eye on this teacher, this upstart that didn't go through their schools. They wanted to know more about him. And that whole period of delight and wonder at Jesus teaching and healing gives way to this final week of Jesus life that we've been looking at. In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus has come by his predefined plan to Jerusalem for the Passover feast. News of his coming stirred up all of the crowds. And they're lining the streets and they're shouting hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. People are praising him. People are wondering, is this the Christ? Is this the one who's finally going to kick out the Romans who are oppressing us? And his entry into the crowded city stirs the attention of the greater religious leaders, the chief priests and this group called the Sadducees. And then always the Pharisees. They were always on the watch at this time for those who would stir up trouble. They were concerned that the Romans would come down with a heavy hand if anyone caused any trouble. And so opposition to Jesus quickly becomes very pronounced. The religious establishment, the political establishment, everybody's on high alert. They don't want this to go poorly. And then he comes into the temple and his actions and his words there, where he asserts his authority over everybody who was claiming authority at that time, deepens their animosity towards him and they begin to plot against him. And Jesus leaves Jerusalem after these temple confrontations, and he begins to speak privately to his disciples. He speaks about an upcoming destruction of this beautiful city that they've come to for worship and for celebration. And then he speaks of his Own second coming, his return at the end of the age to judge the living and the dead. That it would be sudden, no one would know when, that it would be visible, it would be inescapable. Jesus would be seen by all mankind that it would be a time of division. There would be those who would be in the kingdom and those who would not. And it would be a time when all that we did, it would be affirmed that our lives mattered, our works mattered. And last week we began to look at the final section of the Gospel of Matthew. Jesus brings the disciples down from his talking about grand things at the end of all age right into the now, right into the present time. And the plot becomes very thick, the cross is very near. We're made aware in the Bible of the plot of the religious leaders to kill Jesus at this point. And that they're just looking for an opportunity. And then they find that opportunity through the willingness of one of Jesus own disciples, Judas, who's willing to betray Jesus for a small amount of money. And you may remember that caused us to reflect on the question of how do we see Jesus value? How much value do we place on him? In today's text as his arrest and eventual crucifixion are only hours away, Hours away, Jesus has a last meal with his disciples. And we're going to consider that supper. What happened? And the words that were spoken. So hear the word of the lord from Matthew 26. Now, on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus saying, where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover? And he said, well, go into the city to a certain man and say to him, the teacher says, my time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples. And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover. When it was evening, he reclined at table with the 12. And as they were eating, he said, truly I say to you, one of you will betray me. And they were very sorrowful. They began to say to him, one after another, is it I, Lord? And he answered, he who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me. The Son of Man goes as it is written of him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born. Judas, who would betray him, answered, is it I, Rabbi? And and he said to him, you've said so. Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it, he broke it. And he gave it to his disciples and said, take, eat. This is my body. And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. This is the word of the Lord this morning, the feast of Unleavened Bread. On the first day of Unleavened bread, one of the three main feasts that the Jews celebrated, it was tightly connected to Passover, the sort of almost interchangeable, not quite. But they were all pointing to the same time in the history of Israel. And it was the time of celebration related to the Lord delivering his people from slavery in Egypt. That's what these, this feast pointed to. And particularly Passover. There were certain foods that were eaten during this feast, of course. There was the lamb that was slaughtered and eaten. There was the unleavened bread. There was the wine. The scriptures were read by Jesus Day. The tradition seems to have developed to the point where a set of psalms called The Hallel Psalms 113 to 118 would be read at this meal or sung songs of praise. It was a happy feast. The meal was to be eaten within, properly within the confines of Jerusalem. You're supposed to go to the city to eat the Passover because the lamb had to be sacrificed there at the temple. It was a time with family. It was a time with one's closest associates. It was a time of considering how the Lord had cut off the old ways of Egypt and brought his people into through the sea, through the wilderness, into the promised land, into a new way. In the Old Testament, the reason given for celebrating this feast was that all the days of your life, you may remember the day when you came out of Egypt. Every year they would have this feast for this point that the scripture stated that all the days of your life, you'd remember one thing. You'd remember the day when you came out of Egypt. You'd remember your salvation. And so this now was upon them a meal that everybody would look forward to, the highlight of the year. This was their equivalent in its best, in its best picture of a Christmas feast, of a time where everyone was gathered to celebrate. Now, all feasts have details. Any feast that you have with your family that's in any way extended always has details. Whose house are we going to have it at? That's usually the first one. Where are we going to have it? Then you're going to ask yourselves who's bringing what and what is on the menu. And I need to buy the food, I need to take care of things, I need to prepare for that meal. The preparations are extensive. The eating usually goes a lot quicker than the preparations or the cleanup. The eating is always the fastest part, but the preparations are extensive. And so it would have been the case here. And the disciples are anxious about a question which they ask at the beginning. Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover? It's time to get started, getting the meal ready. Where are we going to eat this meal? And Jesus says something which has created all kinds of speculation, which we don't even need to care too much about, but says, go into the city to a certain man and say to him, the Teacher says, my time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples. Whose house was it going to be at? Well, what we have in the Bible is that it's going to be at a certain man's house. And that's what we know. Not anything more is given to us. But it appears that this man obviously would have known, known who Jesus was. He wasn't a random person. He was someone who had likely heard that Jesus would talk about his time being at hand, which could have been a wide variety of things. But most of them believed that when Jesus, if they believed he was the Christ, that his time was coming near, that it was about time for him to come in and, you know, do what he came to do. Kick out the Romans and all of that. So here's a follower of Jesus, and he obviously is wealthy enough that he owns a property in Jerusalem that can accommodate a family meal like the one that they're going to have. Note that Jesus is surprised by nothing. He knows exactly, all the time, exactly what he's doing. He's pre thought through where he's going to have this meal. He knows that his time is at hand. Jesus knows the cross is very close. Jesus knows that he will be hanging to die within 24 hours or so. Every action you see, every word that he's taking or speaking at this point, must have that running through his mind. Here is Jesus. His time is at hand. The reality of what's going on is right in the front of his mind. And so it gets very, very serious. The disciples do exactly as Jesus asks. They go into the city, they prepare the Passover for them. It's like, this is the happiest day of the year. This is the fun festival. We're going to go and we're going to have this great meal together and celebrate God's salvation. And Jesus maybe at this point in time, is going to go in and, you know, here it comes. So there's an anticipation that's happy. The feast is set. Jesus and the 12 are reclining and couches as they would in that time around. And it begins. And then there's this shocking prediction. Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me. The disciples wanted to share the Passover with Jesus. Who wouldn't? They wanted to share the Passover with Jesus. He was, in the minds of most of them, the Christ. He was the king. He was their king. Still, despite Jesus's declarations about upcoming events that he would make periodically, they likely saw this festival as the time that Jesus would somehow take over, that the victory would be won, that the Romans would be removed, that the nation would be restored to all of its former glory. I mean, hadn't Jesus entered Jerusalem with all of the praises on the lips of everybody, Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. I mean, I wonder what it was like for them. I mean, that day when he came in, they must have been like just thrilled. And then he goes into the temple and he hacks everybody off. The crowd still like him, but all the religious leadership is really intense. And it gets intense. And then he starts talking about intense things. And it only is getting more intense. Maybe, maybe the meal will fix him. Maybe the meal will get Jesus back on track. But everything had gotten very serious. And now this one of you will betray me. In the midst of the Passover celebration, a happy feast. Jesus speaks of betrayal. He speaks like the psalmist does. In Psalm 55. He says, it's not an enemy who taunts me, because then I could bear it. It's not an adversary who deals insolently with me, because then I could hide from him. But it's you as a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend. My companion has stretched out his hand against his friends. He's violated his covenant. His speech is as smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart. Or maybe Psalm 41. Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me. There are the disciples, eating, reclining, listening. One of you is like that. Now, the Bible tells us that they all became very sorrowful. They began to search their hearts. I Suppose. Could it be me? Am I even possible? It couldn't be me. I couldn't do that. Am I capable of this? And it came out of their mouths, is it I, Lord? Is it I? Are you talking about me? Jesus, in his way, gives them a very vague answer, doesn't he? He says, it is the one. He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me. They had all shared his food. They had all dipped the hand in the dish with him. They all fit into that category. And the truth is that although only Judas would betray him, the rest would abandon him, would deny that they knew him, would hide from the association that they had with him. These are some of the sins that Jesus would bear for them on the cross. And we would have done no better anyway. Jesus continues, and he says that the Son of man goes as it is written of him. The Son of Man goes as it is written of him. In other words, what is happening to me now? It's already been. This is already in there. Isaiah 53 the suffering servant passage he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. Upon him was the chastisement which brought us peace. And with his wounds we are healed. For all we, like sheep, have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. The suffering servant or maybe, and probably both of these are in his mind. All of These are Psalm 22 the forsaken Christ My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? I am a worm and not a man. Scorned by mankind and despised by the people. All who see me will mock me. They'll make mouths at me. They wag their heads. They've pierced my hands and feet. I can count all my bones. They stare, they gloat at me. They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. The forsaken Christ, the Son of man, must go as it is written. This is what was written. This is how it's going to go down. And then, of course, the struck shepherd of Zechariah 13 Strike the shepherd, and all the sheep will be scattered. The cross was a plan, a way that Jesus, the Son of man, was to go. Nothing happens outside of God's definitive plan. All things are directed by him. But Jesus continues, and he says something so harsh. He says, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born the scripture says that the disciples were sorrowful, but I would imagine that one wasn't, and that was Judas. He knew he was being paid to do exactly what Jesus was talking about. He was, the scripture says, seeking. Even at that moment, he would be seeking an opportunity to patronize, betray him. That's what Judas was doing during the meal. Is this the time when can we get him? And now, probably to his great surprise, Jesus makes this prediction. One of you is going to betray me. And I would imagine that Judas is feeling the heat, maybe in an effort to keep attention away from himself, to kind of join in the crowd, maybe curious to see if Jesus really knew, maybe hoping that Jesus was thinking of somebody else. You know, kind of maybe had this proud thought that because he thought that Jesus was a fraud, there are likely two or three other disciples that maybe had the same thought secretly that he just didn't know about. And maybe Jesus is talking about them. We don't know. But we know he joins in on the course, is it I? And Jesus tells him, yes, it is. Now, right here is the most important moment in the story. And it's the most important moment in yours too. Because when David the King was called out by the prophet Nathan because of his sin with Bathsheba, David said, it is I, I have sinned against the Lord. Not is it I, but it is I, I did it. When the crowds were confronted later by Peter about the fact that they were culpable for Jesus hanging on the cross, the Bible says that they were cut to the heart. What must we do to be saved? It is us. We did it. It's our fault. When you're confronted with your own sin, hopefully you're ready to acknowledge, is I, we all sin. That's not what distinguishes Christians from the rest of the world, that we're not sinners and non Christians are. We're all sinners. It's what we do when we're confronted with sin or when we realize that we sin. We take no solace at all in saying things like, well, we're all broken people as an excuse to do nothing, to not deal with our sin. We don't try to blame our sin on someone else. We don't try to deny our sins. Christians say, it is I, I did it, it's mine, I confess it. And Judas could have confessed, but he doesn't. He's not cut to the heart. Even though he knew Jesus was onto him, he was not cut to the heart. In fact, we know that Judas would soon leave the table and maybe With a bit of new resolve, maybe with a little bit of fear. I've got to get Jesus out of the way. He knows about me. He goes to the chief priests, the religious leaders, to report to them that now would be a great time for them to come and to arrest Jesus. The dinner, like this entire time in Jerusalem had taken a sad turn. It just had taken this serious turn. And now Jesus does one more thing before the dinner ends, and that is that he makes a promise, a promise that won't be fulfilled for some time, and a promise that remains with us today. The Bible says that now, after, as they were eating, Jesus took bread and he blessed it, and then he broke it. And then he gave it to his disciples. And he says something that they would totally have not been expecting. It would have sounded like, what are you talking about? He says to them, take, eat. This is my body. This is my body. Eat that. And he then takes a cup of wine and he gives thanks and to the Lord, and then he gives it to his disciples. And again he says something that would have been outside of the framework of their expectation. He says, drink of it, all of you, for this is the blood of my covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. His body to eat, his blood to drink. What would become a regular part of our worship as Christians had its beginning. We didn't make that up. It had its beginning right here in this moment in history. This is the moment when it happened. These men reclining around the table, eating this meal with Jesus. Jesus thinking of his upcoming death on the cross. Jesus thinking of them. Jesus thinking of his love for them, which would be demonstrated in his laying down his life for them. Christ himself gave these things to his disciples. He served them as he always did, because the greatest among you will be your servant. He serves them. He's the master of the feast. And he wanted the Last Supper to be one where gifts were given. And so he gives them gifts. Bread and wine, body and blood. But what do these things point to? What do they mean? And he hints at it for them. Christ is saying that all those who share in his meal, who take of his body and blood, will have forgiveness of sins. It's poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. And the connection with the blood of Christ or with the blood, is that the forgiveness of sins is a costly thing. Jesus can't just say that you're forgiven and nothing happen. It would cost his body and blood. His substitutionary death on the cross for us. Forgiveness of sins. And Christ Also calls the drink the blood of the covenant. The covenant, that loving commitment between God and His people, between Christ and his people. Jesus is establishing this. This is his new community. Those who are united to him by faith. These disciples who wouldn't fully understand this until later would be the first ones, the followers of Jesus. Thousands, millions would follow. They would be identified by their union with Christ. The covenant, the connection, the new covenant that Jesus was establishing. There's so much identifying that goes on in our world, isn't there? I mean, we were talking the other night kind of lightly. So if you all are really into these things, I suppose you can be, but enneagrams. Okay, what are you? Are you a 1, 5, 8, 9? Are you a lion, a turkey, a monkey, butterfly? An owl? I mean, you know, where you identify people by a number. You identify their personality by like a name, an animal. You know, of course we, we label people all the time. We call this person toxic, this person racist, this person socialist, or positively, you know, this person. You should listen to them. They're an expert, they're an authority on this or that. But the only identity that matters, the only identity that matters, the only one really that matters is Christian. Do you belong to Christ? That's it. That's what matters. Do I belong to Christ? Do I eat the bread? Do I drink the wine with gratitude and joy, knowing that I am united by in Christ? I am united to Jesus in His death and resurrection. That's his promise to me. It's never going away. He's all. I'm always going to be connected to him because of his work on the cross, because of what is symbolized and what we see him doing and giving the disciples here, that's the question. Am I a Christian? It's the only question that matters. Are you a Christian? And if you're here today and you're not, why, why do you resist Him? You've got to ask yourself those questions. Christ also says that it will be poured out for many, not for everyone. The redemption, the forgiveness of sins that would be accomplished through the cross of Christ would be given to many. And so it has been, even as there are also many who will not believe, who will die in their sin, who, as Jesus said earlier, will be cast away from him forever in the day, day of judgment. But for many, he would pour out his blood, call many to himself. Jesus, in these dinner moments is instituting a new sacrament, a new celebration which continues to this day. The Lord's Supper. And the Lord's Supper is greater than the Passover celebration that they were celebrating. Whereas the Passover celebrated the Lord's rescue of a people from slavery in Egypt, the Lord's Supper celebrates our deliverance from sin, from the world, the flesh and the devil. It proclaims the victory of Christ over all of those things. The sacrifice is greater too. The Passover was a lamb. The Lord's Supper is a remembrance of the sacrifice of Christ Himself, the Son of God. The audience is greater. No longer is it simply a celebration for Jews who could squeeze into Jerusalem, but it's a celebration for all nations in all times. And now, in these last words that were recorded here, Jesus makes a promise. And he says that one day he will drink this wine again with them in His Father's kingdom. The Apostle Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, notes that this sacrament, the Lord's Supper, is to be celebrated by Christians until that day. He says, for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. Every month we celebrate the Supper, and next week we'll do it again. And God's people will continue to do that until Jesus returns. Until he comes. One day, Jesus says he will drink this wine again with them in His Father's kingdom. Judas, of course, will miss all of this. His heart was darkened by greed. He would not confess. Even when it became clear that his plans were not secret to Jesus. He would hope that Jesus would just go away. And there are many today who are in that place. They simply wish Jesus would go away. He bothers them. His direct way of dealing with sin makes them nervous, afraid, irritated. So they ignore Him. They mock his people. They try to set him aside, but not so the Christian brothers and sisters. Christ gave his life on the cross that your sins would be forgiven. May we confess our sins freely. May we repent and strive to follow Jesus daily. May we know his word. May we know Him. May we pray and worship together and grow in our love for one another as he calls, calls us to do, as we look forward together to that great day when we too will drink with him in His Father's kingdom. Because one day Jesus will return. And as we've heard already, he will return. He will come as judge. The kingdom will become fully established. And some will be told that they must depart. But for all who believe, who trust Christ, we will see him, and we'll see him make all things new. And we'll live to see the day. We will see the day when sin and sorrow and pain and death will be no more. You will see it with your eyes. And there will be a great multitude from every nation who will gather before the throne of God and will be among them. The Bible says, before the Lamb, before Christ, and will cry out with the rest. Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon his throne. And unto the Lamb may blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power, and might be to our God forever and ever. And we'll gather around and we'll celebrate the great feast, because then he'll take us home to heaven. And at his table we'll sit down and Christ will gird himself and serve us with sweet manna all around. The bread of life will be shared, the wine of joy will flow, the blessings will never end. And all eternity will be before us. And Christ, the master of the feast, will be present in all his glory. Oh, what a day that will be. Let's pray. Father in heaven, we're grateful for the gift of your Son, for his willingness to shed his blood, to have his body nailed to the cross for our salvation. We pray that by the power of the Holy Spirit working in us, that we would live lives of confession and repentance, of faith and obedience, that we would rejoice in the Lord's Supper when it's served. We would look forward to the day when we will share it with Jesus himself in your kingdom. Until that day, we pray that you would be with us and that in all things we would trust you and glorify your name. And it's in the name of Jesus, our Lord, that we pray. Amen.
