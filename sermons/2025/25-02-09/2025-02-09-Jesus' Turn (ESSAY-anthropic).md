# The Most Important Question

What do you think about Jesus? This turns out to be the most important question anyone can ask. Not just for religious people, but for everyone.

When Jesus asked the religious leaders of his time "What do you think about the Christ?", he wasn't trying to trap them like they had tried to trap him. He was asking the central question that everything else revolves around.

The religious leaders thought they knew the answer. To them it was as simple as 1+1=2: the Christ would be a descendant of King David. They had memorized all the prophecies and requirements. But they had missed something big.

Jesus pointed them to Psalm 110, where David calls the Christ "Lord." This created a puzzle they couldn't solve: How could the Christ be both David's son (and therefore lesser than David) and also David's Lord (and therefore greater than David)?
It's like looking at the night sky and mistaking a space shuttle launch for the blinking light of an airplane. The religious leaders had reduced the Christ to something small and manageable - just another king like David. But Jesus was suggesting something much bigger.
This is still how people often think about Jesus today. They're willing to accept him as a good teacher or moral example - a kind of ancient lifestyle guru. But they balk at the full implications of who he claimed to be.

Those implications become clear after his resurrection. The early Christians saw that Psalm 110 wasn't just about the Christ being David's descendant - it was about him being at God's right hand, ruling over everything, even death itself. This was way beyond what anyone expected from a mere human king.

The religious leaders responded to this claim with hostility. They tried to destroy Jesus because he wouldn't fit into their predetermined categories. The crowds, when they finally understood what he was saying, had a different response: "What should we do?"

That's still the key question today. If Jesus really is who he claimed to be - not just a good teacher but the Son of God seated at God's right hand - then we can't remain neutral. We either have to reject him like the religious leaders did, or accept him and adjust our lives accordingly.
This explains why arguments about Jesus get so heated. If he's just another religious figure, we can comfortably ignore him. But if he's God's Son who will one day return as judge, that changes everything. No wonder people prefer to keep him small and manageable.
The religious leaders couldn't solve the puzzle Jesus posed because they weren't willing to accept the obvious but radical solution: that Jesus was both fully human (David's son) and fully divine (David's Lord). They wanted a Christ who would fit their expectations. Instead they got one who shattered them.

We face the same choice today. We can try to make Jesus fit our preferences, reducing him to something comfortable and manageable. Or we can accept him as he actually presented himself - as something far bigger and more demanding than we expected.
What do you think about Christ? It's not just a theological puzzle. It's the most important question you'll ever answer.
