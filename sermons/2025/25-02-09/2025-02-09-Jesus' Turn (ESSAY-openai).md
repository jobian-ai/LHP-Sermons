The Pharisees thought they had Jesus cornered. They had tried to trap him with questions about taxes, the resurrection, and the law. But every time, he answered so well that the crowd was left marveling, and his opponents were left frustrated. Now it was his turn to ask them a question: "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?"

They answered immediately. "The son of David." Of course. Everyone knew that. It was the simplest answer possible, the most basic theological fact about the Messiah. It was so obvious that it required no thought. But Jesus wasn’t asking just to hear their answer. He had a follow-up: "Then how does David, in the Spirit, call him Lord? If David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"

Silence. They had nothing to say.

This was a serious problem for them, because it wasn’t a trick question. It was a fundamental one. They believed the Messiah would be another great king, in the line of David, but ultimately still in David’s shadow. But here was a psalm—Psalm 110—that said David himself called this coming king "Lord." That meant he wasn’t just David’s descendant. He was greater than David.

That idea didn’t fit into their framework. They had been waiting for someone like David, maybe even slightly better, but not someone categorically different. They expected a political savior, someone who would overthrow the Romans and restore Israel’s independence. But Jesus was pointing to something much bigger. The Messiah wasn’t just another king. He was something more. And that terrified them.

They had been happy to debate taxes and obscure theological points, but they were not prepared to answer this question. Because this question wasn’t about theory—it was about Jesus himself. By bringing up Psalm 110, Jesus was telling them, without directly stating it, who he really was. The crowds had been shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" when he entered Jerusalem, and he never corrected them. He accepted their praise. And now, with this question, he was telling the Pharisees they had underestimated what the title "Son of David" actually meant.

They expected a king who would reign in David’s place. But what they got was a king who would reign at God’s right hand.

No wonder they stopped asking questions. They didn’t just fail to answer this one. They realized they were up against something they didn’t understand, something that went beyond their categories. They were staring at the fulfillment of prophecy, and they didn’t like what it meant. If Jesus was right, then their whole framework was wrong.

That’s the problem with assuming you already know the answer. The Pharisees thought they had the Messiah figured out. They thought they could spot him when he came. But when he did, he didn’t fit their expectations. They were expecting a bright light in the distance, and instead, they got a rocket launch.

That’s what Psalm 110 is—a rocket launch. The most quoted psalm in the New Testament. The early Christians couldn’t stop talking about it. Peter used it at Pentecost to explain Jesus’ resurrection and ascension: "The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool." Paul used it to describe Christ’s ultimate victory, not just over Rome, but over death itself. The writer of Hebrews used it to explain Jesus’ role as both king and priest.

The Pharisees didn’t get it. But the disciples eventually did. And when they did, everything changed. Because if Jesus is the Lord that David spoke of, then he isn’t just another human king. He’s the Son of God, reigning at the right hand of the Father. That’s what the resurrection proved. That’s why his rule is unshakable. And that’s why, one day, every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.

It’s easy to be like the Pharisees. To assume we already know who Jesus is. To think of him as a historical figure, a wise teacher, maybe even a good moral leader. But the real question isn’t whether we acknowledge him. It’s whether we bow before him. The Pharisees weren’t ready to do that. Some of the crowd wasn’t either. But others, when they finally understood, were cut to the heart. And they asked the only question that mattered: "What shall we do?"

Peter’s answer was simple: Repent. Believe. Follow the risen King.

Jesus isn’t a small light in the distance. He’s not just another teacher or another leader. He’s the one who reigns at God’s right hand. The one who defeated death. The one who is coming again. And when he does, there will be no mistaking who he is.
