# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 11 MAY 2025 "Living Hope"

## Hope: More Than a Wishful Thought

There's a big difference between hope and optimism. Optimism is a belief that things will work out. Hope is deeper. It's an anchor that holds even when everything is falling apart.

I've been thinking about hope lately after reading Peter's first letter. It's striking how densely packed this and other New Testament letters are. Modern writing aims for clarity through simplicity. Biblical writing achieves depth through density. Each sentence contains thoughts that invite reflection. You don't just read it; you pore over it.

In the opening of his letter, Peter writes something remarkable: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. According to His great mercy, He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."

A living hope. Not just hope, but a living hope. What does that mean?

## The Nature of Hope

First, living hope is necessary in a broken world. Jesus looked at crowds and saw people who were "harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd." Paul reminded the Ephesians that before Christ, they "had no hope and were without God in the world." That's a terrible place to be.

Our world feels much the same today. It's anxious and depressed. People are searching but without direction. We all sin and are sinned against. This creates a desperate need for genuine hope.

Second, living hope is a blessing precisely because the world is broken. If we lived in perfect bliss, we wouldn't need hope. Hope exists because suffering exists. They're connected. In fact, Paul argues that suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, and character produces hope. The path to hope runs through suffering.

This creates an interesting paradox. Those with relatively trouble-free lives often have the weakest hope. When everything's going well, hope seems unnecessary. Why do I need hope if I just got a raise? Why do I need hope if my vacation starts next week? This comfort breeds complacency. We forget how fragile life is, how close death stands, how soon we'll face judgment.

Third, living hope is, well, living. It's not static. It grows and develops. Our hope as Christians isn't just an intellectual assent to facts. It's not merely acknowledging "Yes, when I die, I'll go to heaven." That's true, but it's a yawner.

Living hope is dynamic. It's a growing confidence that God is at work even in difficult situations. It's anchored in past events but looks forward beyond the grave. This is what distinguishes biblical hope from the world's dead hopes.

## The World's Dead Hopes

The world is full of dead hopes—essentially wishful thinking dressed up as optimism. Make a wish when you blow out birthday candles. Make a wish when you see a shooting star. Throw a coin in a fountain and make a wish. This is the best the world offers: wishful thinking.

Even if these shallow hopes are realized, they're short-lived and can't survive the grave. People hope to be loved, to gain recognition, to find fulfillment. To achieve these hopes, they might get married, make friends, take new jobs, follow health regimens, or try religion.

None of these pursuits is bad in itself. Some are quite good. But as objects of ultimate hope, they're misplaced. Spouses fail us. Marriages strain. Friends neglect or betray us. Employers recognize decades of work with a certificate saying "thank you." A religion that views Jesus as a fix for problems soon discovers He isn't here for that—at least not in the way people expect.

And age catches up with everyone, even the healthiest among us. Worldly hopes lead to disappointment because they're too short-sighted. True living hope must look past death.

That's why Paul said, "If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied."

## The Author of Hope

Where does living hope come from? It's important to identify what isn't the source first.

We aren't the authors of living hope. We can't dispense it freely to others because we're weak and sinful. We don't hold the future in our hands, so we can't promise much of anything to anyone. We might not be alive to fulfill promises, or we might be prevented from keeping them.

People who promise hope—politicians, counselors, experts—aren't its authors either. Every four years, politicians talk about hope for things they can't deliver.

Circumstances guarantee nothing. Life can change in a moment. Many people misdirect their hope toward changed circumstances: "If I can have a new spouse, job, or approach to life, everything will be fixed." But changed circumstances aren't the authors of living hope.

Peter tells us the real author: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." Our Father in heaven is the source of hope.

Peter emphasizes that it's "according to His great mercy" that we have living hope. Without His mercy, there is no hope. Without sin's removal, there is no hope. We'd be "dead in our sins under the wrath of God" or as Paul put it, "without God and without hope in the world."

But God's mercy changes everything. Our sins aren't held against us. Death and hell are defeated. Eternal life is given. Even our suffering becomes purposeful, pointing us toward hope rather than despair.

Consider Jeremiah, watching Jerusalem burn, his friends slaughtered or captured. He cries to God: "Remember my affliction and my wanderings, the wormwood and the gall! My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me."

What does he do? "But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness."

Jeremiah, under incredible suffering, calls something to mind that gives him hope: God's unchanging character. No matter the circumstances, God's steadfast love never ceases. His mercy never ends. Every morning brings new acts of faithfulness toward His people.

## How We Possess Hope

Since we don't create hope, we can only receive it as a gift. Peter emphasizes that all three persons of the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—work for our benefit.

First, "He has caused us to be born again." It's the Father's work, His mercy, His foreknowledge, His kindness in sending His Son. He leaves nothing to chance. Every good gift comes from Him.

Second, we're born again by His Spirit. Jesus said, "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit." The Spirit breathes life into us, applies Christ's redemption, and gives us new hearts.

Third, we're born again "through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." The resurrection makes all hope possible. As Paul declared, if Christ isn't raised, we have no hope.

Peter knew what hopelessness felt like. He denied Jesus three times, then watched Him die, thinking, "I'll never be able to apologize for the worst act of my life" and "Did I waste my life serving a dead Christ?"

Then came the resurrection. Peter writes from experience, wanting us to grasp that through Christ's resurrection, there is genuine hope. As Paul wrote, "God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ."

## Our Response

What's the proper response to all this? Peter shows us: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."

The response is praise. In Christ, if you've repented and believed, you have a new family—a family of hope. Not wishful thinking, but living hope in a living God who takes those dead in sin and gives them new life, new hearts, and a future beyond the grave.

May we be people who praise God, who "according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
