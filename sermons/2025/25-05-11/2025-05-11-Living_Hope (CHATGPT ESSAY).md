# LHCP Sunday Morning Sermon - 11 MAY 2025 "Living Hope"

## Living Hope

Most people think of hope as a kind of optimistic wish. Like blowing out candles or making a wish on a star. We think of hope as wanting something good to happen. But that’s not what Peter means when he writes about a “living hope.” He’s not talking about something flimsy or sentimental. He’s talking about something that’s alive. Something that grows. Something that comes from the resurrection of Jesus.

Peter doesn’t ease into it. He starts with worship: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” That’s the response you have when you realize what’s happened. That, according to His mercy, God has caused us to be born again to a living hope. Not offered. Not invited. Caused. He did it. Not us. And because it comes from Him, it doesn’t die when things go bad. It doesn’t shrink in suffering. It grows.

A dead hope is one that ends when things go wrong. When the job falls through. When the diagnosis comes. When your friends disappear. When you sin again and you’re sick of repenting. A living hope survives all that. In fact, that’s when it starts to show what it’s made of. Peter doesn’t say this to people who are doing great. He says it to exiles. To people who are scattered and suffering. To people who know what it feels like to be helpless. People who know what it feels like to be ashamed.

Living hope is for people like that.

It’s important that Peter doesn’t say this hope comes from a new mindset or a positive habit. It comes from an event. The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. That’s the anchor. That’s what makes it real. If Jesus is still in the tomb, there’s no hope. But if He’s alive, everything changes. Hope isn’t wishful thinking. It’s trust that God has already acted in history, and He’ll act again. And since death couldn’t stop Him then, nothing can stop Him now.

That’s why Peter calls it living. It’s not just something you believe. It’s something that grows with you. A Christian’s hope isn’t static. It expands. It deepens. It matures. The more you suffer, the more it wakes up. Paul says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, and character produces hope. That’s a strange order. Most people think hope comes first, and then you survive. But for Christians, suffering is what uncovers hope. It’s what lets you see that your hope isn’t in the world, or yourself, or your circumstances. It’s in Christ. It has to be.

We don’t produce this hope. God gives it. He gives it because He’s merciful. That’s the whole point. It’s not earned. It’s caused. You can’t will yourself into it. You can only receive it. That’s why Peter starts with praise. Because this isn’t a strategy. It’s grace.

A living hope doesn’t mean you won’t suffer. It means your suffering won’t be wasted. It means you’ll never be without God. And if you have Him, you have everything. You may lose everything else. You may feel cast down and confused. But you’re not hopeless. Because Jesus rose. And your hope lives.
