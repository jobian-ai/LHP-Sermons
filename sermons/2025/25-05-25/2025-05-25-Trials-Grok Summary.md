SUMMARY (162 words)

The sermon on 1 Peter 1:6–7 explores trials in the Christian life, following discussions of living hope and an imperishable, undefiled, unfading inheritance. Peter, writing to elect exiles (Christians), describes trials as various (loss, persecution, illness), present, temporary, necessary, and grievous. Their purpose is to test the genuineness of faith, grow steadfastness in Christ, and complete faith for praise at Christ’s return. Trials are not random but part of God’s plan, as seen in Jesus’ necessary sufferings. Christians respond by rejoicing—before, during, and after trials—rooted in hope and inheritance. Rejoicing isn’t superficial but a deep joy from knowing God’s faithfulness, exemplified by Christ’s endurance. Trials expose faith’s reality, teach reliance on Christ, and prepare believers for eternity. The Gospel fuels this joy, as Christ’s redemption ensures a future without grief. Christians are urged to lean on Christ, finding freedom and even compassion amid trials, and to anticipate eternal worship.
