**Trials**

When people talk about the Christian life, they tend to emphasize the good parts—peace, joy, hope, salvation. And that's fair. Those are the promises. But Peter, in the first chapter of his letter, throws in a surprise. He says something most of us try not to think about: trials are part of the package too.

He doesn’t mention them to spoil the mood. He’s being realistic. The Christian life isn’t trouble-free. It comes with grief. The strange part is, Peter says you should rejoice. Not because you like pain, but because of what the pain does.

Peter makes five points about trials that are easy to miss if you read too fast. First, they’re _various_. That’s the word he uses—various. Which means you never know what form they’ll take. Loss, illness, relational tension, rejection, persecution. Some people carry ten different burdens at once, while others seem fine until one big trial breaks everything open. There’s no standard form. They’re custom-fit.

Second, they’re _now_. Trials are not hypothetical. You’re either in one, coming out of one, or walking into one. That’s the normal state of things. It’s not abnormal to be struggling. What’s abnormal is pretending you’re not.

Third, they’re _for a little while_. That one sounds off. Trials rarely _feel_ short. They feel endless. Like road trips when you’re five. But “a little while” makes more sense when you view life on an eternal scale. If this life is just the front porch of forever, then everything here—pain included—is temporary. That’s not wishful thinking. That’s the perspective Peter gives.

Fourth, they’re _necessary_. This is maybe the hardest part. Trials aren’t just allowed. They’re required. You only face them, Peter says, if _necessary_. That word should bother you a bit. Necessary for what? He doesn’t leave you guessing: for testing the genuineness of your faith. Faith is invisible until something hard makes it visible. And that doesn’t happen accidentally. Peter wants you to know your trials aren’t random. They’re appointed.

Fifth, trials _grieve_ us. Peter doesn’t downplay that. They’re not just hard. They hurt. Sometimes you cry alone in silence. Sometimes you fall apart publicly. Trials rip things away—people, dreams, stability—and you’re left trying to breathe through the wreckage. That’s part of the deal too. Peter doesn’t suggest you hide the pain. He just says there’s something under it.

So what is it? What’s underneath all this difficulty? Why is faith tested like gold in fire?

Because faith, real faith, matters. A lot. It’s how you hold on when there’s nothing else to hold. It’s not about becoming tougher or more self-reliant. That’s what people think trials are for. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” But that’s not always true. Sometimes it just makes you bitter, or numb. What Peter says is deeper: trials don’t make you strong; they make you _lean_. They show you whether your weight is resting on Christ or on something shakier.

That’s the point of the fire—not to destroy you, but to reveal what can’t be destroyed.

And something else happens too. Trials grow you. Not like fertilizer grows flowers, but more like how lifting something heavy, over time, builds real strength. Not all at once. Not evenly. But growth nonetheless. You learn to endure. You learn that God's promises actually hold. You become less impressed with what fades and more anchored in what doesn’t.

Eventually, Peter says, faith is completed. It finishes its course. And on that day—when the trial is over, when Christ is revealed—it results in glory. Not just His, but yours too. Because faith that’s gone through fire shines. It doesn’t disappear. It gets brighter.

Peter’s conclusion is strange and simple: rejoice. Rejoice before the trial, because you already have a living hope and an imperishable inheritance. Rejoice in the trial, because you’re walking where Christ walked. And rejoice at the end of the trial, when all that remains is praise.

That’s the rhythm of the Christian life. Suffering, yes. But also singing. Because in the end, when death is behind you, you will still have your faith. And you will still have Christ. And you’ll have a song that doesn’t end.
