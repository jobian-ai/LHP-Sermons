# Trials

You're reading along in First Peter, chapter one. Peter, a guy who knew Jesus, is writing to Christians, these "elect exiles," about life in Christ. We've already seen hope, this confident expectation. We've seen inheritance, this imperishable, undefiled, unfading eternal life. Sounds pretty good, right? Hope and inheritance. Like a winning lottery ticket.

But if you've been around the block as a Christian, you know it's not all sunshine and rainbows. This "living hope" and "marvelous inheritance" come with something else in this life: trouble. Trials. That's what Peter gets to next. He's going to talk about what these trials are like, why they happen, and how we should respond.

So, Peter says five things about these trials. First, they're "various." Manifold. Lots of different kinds. Loss of family, persecution, strained relationships, loved ones rejecting faith, attacks on the church, sickness, financial loss. You name it. The elders meet for prayer, and even in a relatively small church, the list of burdens is long. And we only know some of it. There's always more, these various trials.

Second, these trials are "now." A present reality. The world we live in is a world of trials. You're going to face them. It's not a matter of if, but when. And they'll be various. That's just how it is, the expected state of things.

Third, these various trials are "now for a little while." Remember being a kid on a car trip? "How long till we get there?" To a kid, that trip feels like forever. But the parent knows it's just a matter of time. A few minutes, a few hours, but eventually, you arrive. It's not forever.

That's how it is with our trials. When you're in the middle of one, it doesn't feel like "a little while." It feels like forever. "Lord, how long?" But if you look at your life here on earth through the lens of eternity, this life is short. And the trials we experience are short-lived. "For a little while," Peter says.

Fourth, our trials are "if necessary." This is a tough one, but Peter says suffering and trials aren't random. Things aren't just happening to you by accident. If you're going through a trial right now, it's because it's necessary. Necessary. Think about Jesus. Was it random that He went through what He did? Peter says no. At Pentecost, he says Jesus was "delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God." Our trials are the same. Not random. Necessary.

Now, this doesn't excuse the people who might inflict suffering on you. Peter notes that Jesus was killed by "lawless men." Throughout Scripture, God's people are trained through trials inflicted by not-so-nice people. Egyptians, Philistines, Assyrians, Babylonians. Not the helpful neighbors. Lawless men. And the Lord used them. The trial was necessary.

He's not excusing wickedness, but he is telling us that our trials are necessary, from God's hand. That's the point.

Fifth, he says trials bring "grief." These necessary trials have brought us great grief. If you've been through one, you know. You've been ripped apart emotionally. You've sat in silence, crying. Wondering if things could have been different. Regretting things said or unsaid. The death of someone close brings grief. And sometimes people who aren't going through it don't know what to do with your grief. "When are you going to get back to normal?" As if wrestling with difficulty is abnormal. "You need to get over it." We grieve. Trials are hard. That's why they're trials.

But we know Christ, who bore our sorrows, is familiar with grief, grieves with us. The Lord who brings trials doesn't delight in our grief. When we take up our inheritance, there will be no more tears, no more grief. "For a little while." The Lord isn't some sadist. He doesn't enjoy making life hard.

So what's the point? These trials that cause grief must be important if God insists we go through them. His Son's death brought our salvation. So, what's the purpose of our trials? The ones you're walking through now?

There's that saying, "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger." Nietzsche said it. But is it true? Not really. What doesn't kill you can make you bitter, angry, despairing, anxious. Strength isn't an automatic outcome. And I don't think that's the Bible's point either. God isn't just about "no pain, no gain."

Peter says the trials test the "genuineness of your faith." That's why they're necessary. Your faith is precious, more precious than gold, which is tested by fire. Your faith needs to be tested to see if it's genuine. Trials do that. They show you where your trust lies. Will you trust the Lord in the midst of difficulty? Be steadfast in your faith in Christ?

James says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness." Trials make us stronger in Christ. They make us lean on Christ. That's their purpose.

They also rip away the other things we put our faith in, showing us what we truly rely on. Calvin said the Lord teaches us about the emptiness of this life through constant suffering, so we don't expect untroubled peace here. He allows wars, uprisings, poverty, loss, so we don't get too attached to this world. Life exposes the fleeting nature of life and tests the genuineness of faith. That's a problem without faith.

The world experiences trials too. Without Christ, they make up songs about getting stronger until they die. They deny reality. They build industries to escape it. But with an inheritance, a resurrection, with Christ before our eyes, these same trials invigorate our hope and faith. When faith is invigorated by hope, it's shown to be genuine because we hold onto Jesus in the midst of it.

Second, trials grow our faith. Psalm 119 says, "It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes." Trials lead to learning, to growing up. Packer said earthly parents enjoy babies but want their children to grow up. The Lord wants us to grow up into the fullness of Christ. We grow through difficulty, through trials. That's how our faith grows.

Third, trials lead to the completion of our faith. Peter says this testing is done so that our faith "may be found to result in praise and glory and honor." It's observed as fully genuine, bringing praise to us and to God, the keeper of our faith. The end result of all the trials is glory and praise and honor. When will that be? At the revelation of Jesus Christ, on the last day. Then faith will be complete.

So, various necessary trials that grieve us have a purpose: to demonstrate the genuineness of our faith, to grow us in faith until it's complete. How should we respond?

Peter starts this section with four words: "In this you rejoice." The Christian is to rejoice before trials even come. He's talking about the inheritance and the living hope. We rejoice that we have these things.

This rejoicing is spiritual. Not just putting on a happy face. It's a deep joy from knowing God and His faithfulness. Even when trials come, we've seen God at work, so we rejoice.

It's different from just saying "it is what it is." It's knowing there's a purpose. God wants to do something in your life. Our mindset is to be one of rejoicing. My Father's keeping an inheritance for me. The road might be hard, but He's promised to bring me home.

We not only rejoice before trials, but in the midst of them. That's when we're most Christ-like, sharing in His sufferings. We rejoice because we know where we're going. Christ is the example. He endured the cross "for the joy set before Him."

When you rejoice in the midst of trials, you're free. Whatever didn't kill you made you lean on Christ. And when you lean on Christ, you're free.

The person afflicting you might be wicked, enslaved by sin. But you don't go there. You might even feel pity and compassion for them. Christians have been known for this: pity for their enemies. Rejoice in your trials.

And we rejoice at the end of our trials. The Israelites at the Red Sea. They couldn't believe it, so they sang and sang.

There will be a time to really sing. Every week we reflect on the end of our greatest trial, the judgment we deserved, endured by Christ. That's why we sing of our Redeemer. We look at the love of Christ and we sing.

One day all the trials will be over. They're just for a little while. Their purposes will be accomplished. And all God's people will be together, singing.
