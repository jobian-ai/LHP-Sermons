# **The Vineyard, the Feast, and the King**  

If you ask most people what they think the Bible is about, they'll probably say something like, "It's about how to live a good life" or "It's about being moral." That's not wrong exactly, but it's incomplete. A big part of the Bible is about something more subtle: how people respond to authority.  

This passage from Matthew 21 is a case study in that. Jesus tells three parables, one after another, all with the same basic theme: How will people respond to the authority of the Father, the Son, and the kingdom they represent?  

The first parable is about a man with two sons. He tells them to go work in the vineyard. One says, "No," but later changes his mind and goes. The other says, "Yes, sir," but never goes. Jesus asks the obvious question: Which one did the will of the father? The religious leaders answer correctly—it's the first one. But then Jesus drops the hammer: "Tax collectors and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you."  

That would have stung. These were the people who saw themselves as righteous, who thought they were on God's side. But Jesus is saying they’re the second son—the one who says the right things but doesn’t follow through. And the sinners they despised? They’re the first son. They start out far from God but repent when they hear the message.  

Then Jesus tells a second parable, this one darker. A landowner rents out his vineyard to tenants. When it’s time to collect the fruit, he sends his servants, but the tenants beat them, kill them, and send them away. Finally, the landowner sends his son, thinking, “Surely, they’ll respect my son.” But they kill him too, hoping to take the vineyard for themselves.  

Jesus asks the religious leaders what the landowner should do. Their answer? “He’ll bring those wretches to a miserable end and lease the vineyard to others who will give him the fruits.” They don’t realize they’re condemning themselves. Jesus is saying that they’re the wicked tenants, and their rejection of him will result in judgment.  

Finally, Jesus tells a third parable about a king who throws a wedding feast for his son. The invited guests refuse to come. Some make excuses; others kill the messengers. So the king invites everyone—good and bad—to the feast. But when the king finds someone without proper wedding clothes, he throws him out. “Many are called,” Jesus says, “but few are chosen.”  

What’s going on in these stories? On the surface, they’re about how different people respond to God’s authority. But beneath that, they’re about what it means to bear fruit and be part of God’s kingdom.  

### The Vineyard  

The vineyard is a recurring image in the Bible. It represents Israel, God’s people. God planted it, nurtured it, and expects it to bear fruit. But what kind of fruit? Not just obedience to rules. The fruit God desires is deeper—love, mercy, justice, humility.  

The religious leaders thought they were producing fruit by keeping the law. But their fruit was hollow. They cared more about appearances than about truly following God. Meanwhile, the tax collectors and prostitutes—people who seemed hopelessly far from God—heard the message of repentance and bore real fruit.  

### The Feast  

The wedding feast is another picture of the kingdom of God. It’s not just a meal; it’s a celebration, a symbol of the joy and abundance of life with God. But not everyone wants to come.  

Some reject the invitation outright. Others show up but don’t take it seriously—they don’t bother to honor the king with proper wedding clothes. Both groups miss the point. The feast is a gift, but it’s also a call to live in a way that honors the king.  

### What About Us?  

These parables aren’t just stories about the past. They’re for us too. We’re the new tenants of the vineyard, the new guests at the feast. So the question is, how will we respond?  

First, are we bearing fruit? Real fruit, not just going through the motions. Are our lives marked by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control? Are we caring for others, forgiving them, and serving them?  

Second, are we honoring the king? It’s not enough to show up at the feast; we need to come dressed in the righteousness of Christ. That means trusting him, not our own goodness, and living in a way that reflects his character.  

Finally, are we responding to God’s authority with humility? Like the first son, we may start out saying no. But what matters is where we end up. Are we willing to repent, to change, to follow?  

### The Bottom Line  

Jesus’ parables are a challenge and a warning. They remind us that the kingdom of God is a gift, but it’s not one we can take lightly. The invitation is open to everyone, but how we respond matters. Will we reject the king, or will we honor him? Will we bear fruit, or will we squander the vineyard?  

The choice is ours. But the good news is that even if we’ve said no in the past, even if we’ve failed to bear fruit, the invitation is still open. The king is still calling. The feast is ready. Will you come?
