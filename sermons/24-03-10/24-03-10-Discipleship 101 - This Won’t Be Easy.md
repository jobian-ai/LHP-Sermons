Good morning. You can turn with me this morning to Matthew, chapter 10. If you're visiting with us today, we are looking together in the Bible, in the New Testament, at the Gospel of Matthew. It tells us the story of Jesus, and for several weeks now, we have considered Jesus calling people to follow Him. And we've been asking the question, well, why should they follow Him? And seeing that Jesus demonstrates both the desirability and the wisdom of following Him by demonstrating His authority over a variety of things.

So He teaches with authority, and He demonstrates His authority through healing the sick, showing that He has authority over disease. And He shows His authority over all creation by calming the sea. And He shows His authority over the forces of evil and over darkness, and that's made evident when He casts out demons. He has authority over sin and authority over death. And so we see Him forgiving people's sins, and then we see Him raising a young girl from the dead. 

In all of this and in His other healings, Jesus is demonstrating that we ought to follow Him, and He's also demonstrating who He is—that He is the Messiah, the King, the Savior, the Christ. The Bible tells us that, as you can imagine, as Jesus did these things, His fame grew. Crowds would gather; people would come from everywhere to both bring sick people they knew for Jesus to heal and then also to listen to Him, to consider, "Who is this man? What sort of man is this? Is this the one?" These kinds of questions.

He can't escape crowds. He has a very difficult time; He has to wander away into wilderness spots just to get away from people. I don't think any one of us has that problem. Jesus always had crowds around Him. And when He looked at the crowds, as we talked about last week, He looked at the crowds not as a "Wow, look at the size of my following" or in some sort of proud way, but when Jesus looked at the crowds, what He saw were shepherdless sheep, people who, because of the fallenness of the world, were harassed and helpless. And Jesus also looked at the crowds, and He saw a harvest, but He knew that there were just few laborers. 

So He begins to do something about that. He encourages His disciples to pray for laborers to go into the harvest. And He calls the twelve apostles to labor, giving them the authority to preach, the Bible says, and the authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every disease and every affliction. He gives them that authority to go out and do those things. And now He comes to the details, details that pertain not only to them but to all of us. 

How is this all supposed to work? What does following Jesus and discipleship look like? And we're going to look at three words this week that capture the essence of discipleship: the words "go," "beware," and "endure."

So hear the word of the Lord now from Matthew, chapter 10, verses 5 through 23:

These twelve—the twelve apostles—Jesus sent out, instructing them, “Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And proclaim as you go, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart. As you enter the house, greet it. If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.

Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child. And children will rise against parents and have them put to death, and you will be hated by all for my name’s sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

This is the word of the Lord this morning.

We go places all the time. Sometimes a spouse might encourage us to go to the store. Usually that comes with more specificity: “Could you go to ShopRite and pick up this or that thing? Could you go to Wal-Mart or Tractor Supply?” "Go" always has a place associated with it and a list, a reason for going to that place. And of course, sometimes there's instruction. If you're being sent someplace where you're not sure where things are, and the other person knows, they might say, "Go; the thing you're looking for is going to be in the back corner of the store, in the third aisle over, whatever, in the garden supplies."

When Jesus says "go" to the disciples, He has a vision of what is needed and how it's to be done. He's sending them with purpose. And when we look at this today, He sends them somewhere. What's interesting is the text begins with where they're not supposed to go. Don't go to the Samaritans or to the Gentiles. The Samaritans were the set of folks nearby who were sort of a mixed Jewish-Gentile race, and they were seen very negatively by the Jews. We have stories of that in the Bible. And the Gentiles, of course, were the Gentiles. They were the Roman occupiers. They were the people on the other side of the lake. They were those that, again, there was sort of a resistance towards giving anything necessarily good to. Jesus says, "Don't go to the Samaritans or Gentiles."

Jesus is doing this with purpose. He knows that that time is going to come. It's just going to come later. It's not right now. In the book of Acts, when Jesus speaks to the disciples, He calls them to the proclamation of the gospel to be His witnesses, He says, "in Jerusalem, and then in Judea and Samaria," to the Samaritans, "and then to the ends of the earth," to the Gentiles. So He's not being kind of prejudicial, racist, bigot, or whatever. He simply has a purpose that He wants them to do. He wants them to stay focused here because He wants to show them something else.

We find that Paul, actually in his ministry, follows this model wherever he goes. The first place he goes is always to the synagogue, to the Jews there, and he tries to preach the gospel to them. And then, when inevitably or in most cases, he's rejected, he goes to the broader community. Paul says in Romans 1, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."

It's interesting, this phrase, that thought, "to the Jew first and also to the Greek," because in this room, my guess is that at least 99%, possibly 100% of you, are just kind of totally Gentile by the Bible definition. You don't have a lot of Jewish blood in you. And that at least makes it sometimes difficult to understand what's going on in the Bible, because we're on sort of the far end. A lot of time has gone on here, but Jesus is saying something that's very important. Jesus is identifying who He is first and foremost to the disciples, and that is He's the Christ. He's the Messiah. They had waited. They had waited 600 years for this moment. 

Now I have a hard time waiting six minutes for anything. Six hundred years they had waited for the Christ to come. And Christ came. We'll get to the Gentiles. Let's talk first about the glory of God. Let's talk first about the man who would fulfill every single prophecy of the Messiah that had been laid out by all the prophets that everyone was listening to and considered and knew in the entire community, who would have been instructed when they were very young, "One day there's going to be a king who's going to come. One day." All the children, they would all have known. One day he's coming. Why? Because when Abraham received the promise, there was this blessing that went along with it. This blessing that all the nations would be blessed through the seed of Abraham, that one day there would be a man who would come. 

And then there was David. You see, a long time ago, I mean, right now there's Roman soldiers everywhere, but a long time ago there was a king. And this king had received a promise, and the promise was that on the throne there would always be, for all time,

 one of his descendants for all eternity. And that all seemed to just get shot all over the place, but we know that God is true and that one day that king is going to come. And all the children would know it. Their schools would be filled with that knowledge that one day the king would be coming. And then there's the prophet Jeremiah, who talked all about that one day there would be a time where the law of God would be written on the hearts of man, a new covenant, a new way that God would be bringing in. The law of God would be written on the heart. The prophet Isaiah would talk about how out of the stump of Jesse, out of a burnt, knocked-down-to-nothing would arise a branch. Everything points to Jesus.

Jesus himself was Jewish. He's the Christ. We are here today because that's true. Because the promise was that through this person, all of the nations would be blessed. But first this person had to be announced. It's because He is the fulfillment of everything in the Old Testament that His ministry, His love, His salvation, His blessing would go to the ends of the earth. We're the recipients of that blessing in Harford County now today, 2,000 years later. But when Jesus is talking to twelve men before His crucifixion about the message that He wants to go to the Jewish people, He wants them to know that everything that they had ever hoped for in their lives and in their communities and in their nation was here. 

People get all bent out of shape and excited about politics stuff in our own country all the time. They get excited about this guy or that guy, like they're going to do something. All you need to do is take that emotion, that little bit of emotion that people feel, and imagine it a million-fold. You're talking about the Savior of the world. You're talking about the Savior. You're talking about someone who they believe, they knew when He came, it would change everything.

Jesus makes it clear that it's to those people who know that story, who knew that story at that time, that this is the message. It's supposed to go to them first. To the lost sheep of Israel. The lost sheep. It's actually going to be a sheep-to-sheep ministry. They didn't have fancy names like that back then that they would call it, but that would work now probably. Sheep-to-sheep ministry, but it was exactly that. Jesus says this much later when He says, "I'm sending you as sheep into the midst of wolves." In other words, there would be a solidarity between the disciple, the missionary, and the person who is receiving the message. All of them are sheep. It is the shepherd who might be different, and the missionary desires that the solidarity would extend there too. 

Not only are we all sheep, but may it be that we all have the same shepherd. That would be their message. And so it's been with missionaries and people and preachers and congregations all the time. We're all the same. All men, all women, children, sinners. Outside of the mercy of God, under the wrath of God. All of us together. Putting a person up in a high pulpit doesn't make him any different than any of you. However popular a minister might be out in the world, however many people he has viewing his stuff, makes him no different than you. Everybody is a sheep. But every pastor and every missionary who loves the Lord wants us not only to have a shared story of being sinners, but a better shared story. Being saved by God's grace and belonging to Christ, the Savior of sinners, the good shepherd. 

Jesus tells them to go to the lost sheep of Israel first. Tell them the good news that the kingdom is at hand. The kingdom has come. That extends then, of course, to all of us over time, but there in the beginning, it's right that at the beginning of the last year. And what are they proclaiming? Proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom? Good news about God's care for His people in the sending of a king, that everyone needs to repent and turn to God. And then they were given this authority. They would go and proclaim that message, and then they would also do things like heal sick people, and raise the dead, and cleanse lepers, and cast out demons. All demonstrations of authority given to them by the one with the authority to perform all of those miracles. 

The point, though, was never, and never has been, that the point was never in the miracles themselves, but what they pointed to. That the kingdom of heaven was at hand. And that it was in Jesus' name, and by His authority that those things were being done, and that's because Jesus was the king. Well, how were they supposed to do that? Well, they likely went out in pairs, actually. And maybe if you look back a little bit and you see all the names listed, you'll notice that everybody has a—when they list the twelve disciples, they all have a pair. They're listed in pairs, and it's possible that that's how they went out. Those are the two by two. 

But they were given some instructions. The first was that they were to acquire no pay. They weren't to take gold, or silver, or copper. He says, "Don't bring any extra clothing." The authority and the message that they had received, it was free. Jesus gave it to them, and so they were to give it out for free. There were sort of warnings underneath all of that from the Bible in the Old Testament. Warning—the warning of Achan, a man who, after the fall of Jericho, decided that even though everything was supposed to be destroyed, "Why destroy good money?" So he—you know, no one's going to need it—so he snuck a little bit of it out and stuck it in his house. And that story ended up in a disaster for Israel and for him. It wasn't his to take.

Or it's the warning of Elisha's servant, Gehazi, who after Elisha had healed Naaman, and Naaman said, "Well, what do I pay you for this service?" And Elisha said, "Well, I didn't do anything. Nothing. It's free, it's a gift." And Gehazi was like, "Yeah, but Naaman, don't you understand? We need some things around the house." And so he follows Naaman and says, "Actually, you can pay us a little bit." And that goes poorly for him. There's these warnings that the message and the miracles were not meant to be a means of just lining the disciples' pockets. They were gifts to be given. All the needs of those who were going out to proclaim this message were to be met through the hospitality of those who were in a particular town. Jesus says that's the instruction. 

So you're not doing miracles for money. Instead, you're just relying on the hospitality of people. And this is the way that will work. You'll go and you'll find those who are open to listening to the message that are in that particular town. Find someone who's open to listening to the message and being sort of the headquarters, and then you'll just stay there. Now that sounds like, what, strangers? But a little different culturally. That would have been okay. The dangerous places to go were like the Holiday Inn. The houses of people were safe places. So He's like, "Go and stay with someone who will let you stay, who is willing to hear the message that you have for that particular town." The disciples likely weren't going to be asking to stay very long. They weren't freeloading. They just were being fed. Because as Jesus says here, "The laborer deserves his food."

People should open their homes to the disciples. Why should they open their homes to the disciples? Well, because these are the disciples who are backed by Jesus, the King of all creation, the King of Israel whose kingdom has come. They are coming under His authority. I mean, some minuscule, non-significant authority in our own day. Say, like, the President of the United States. Suppose he sends to you at your house one of his representatives and says, "I need to spend an evening here. Do you mind?" Most of you would be like, "Okay with that," because the President asked you a favor. So it's of this nature. There is authority that comes with the disciples, and people should open their homes. But if the laborer is not welcome, Jesus says you just trust the Lord and you move on. 

This is how Matthew says it in the text. He says, "As you enter the house, greet it, and if the house is worthy, then let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. If anyone won't receive you or listen to your words, then shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. Truly I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town."

If it turns out they are worthy, if they are willing to listen to the message and be in a place where these miracles could kind of occur out of their home base, then great. The house is to be blessed. Let your peace come upon it. What a lovely place. What a lovely house it is where the gospel is received with joy. He says, "Let your peace be there." He said, "But if no one is willing to house you, or if after saying they would, you know, and you start talking, they kind of change their minds, being a Christian sounds kind of scary, and they want you to leave, then their peace was to be removed." 

What's the significance of that? It means that with the disciples' proclamation of peace, there would be peace. But without the proclamation of

 peace of the disciples, there would be judgment. Judgment, what Jesus says, is worse than Sodom and Gomorrah, which in the Old Testament was about as bad as you can get. You might find that harsh. That's not in your evangelism manuals. You're supposed to be friends, understanding of the fact that it might be difficult in the midst of Roman occupation to follow Jesus right away. You've got to give them time, time for people to think and time for people to ask pointed questions. But it's not harsh. There is no worse position on the planet Earth than to hear the gospel and to openly reject it. There is no greater position on the planet that we can have than to embrace the gospel. It was true then. It's true now.

The disciples are to go into Israel. They're to go to the lost sheep with the great message of a glorious shepherd. We go into the world in Jesus' name with the exact same gospel. It's so beautiful. The gospel is so beautiful. You and I, sinners, dead in our sin, saved by the grace of God, His Holy Spirit given to you, always present, every concern, every problem, all the struggles that we have as people, that He is always with us, that He will care for us, take us, bless us, and give us every spiritual blessing, the Bible says, and will take us all the way to the end, and then we'll be saved. And then we will be raised from the dead, and then there will be glory, and then there will be rest, and then there will be... It's so beautiful and so magnificent and so praiseworthy. 

One might expect that every town would want to hear it and receive Jesus' disciples joyfully, but Jesus tells us not to be deceived. He says it will absolutely not be easy. In fact, you need to beware. The second word, "go," and then "beware." As I've gotten older, like a lot of men, back pain kind of becomes a reality. And when you lift too much or you try to reach things that are sort of in unreachable places, and you've lost all of the little kids that used to do that for you, and you're trying to make that maneuver, sometimes that doesn't go well. Of course, I don't like to admit any of that too much and so won't always accept that little tweak that's a little bit of a warning sign and the warnings of those who care about me and tell me, "Don't lift that and don't reach there." And not surprisingly, what I end up with when I don't listen to any warnings is back pain. 

And imagine for a moment the disciples. They used to be... I mean, these guys, they used to be like fishermen and a tax collector, and we had one guy who was going to overthrow the government, you know, make Israel great again kind of thing. They were going to do all of this. They were ready to go. But they kind of realized they were weak men. And then all of a sudden, now picture yourself. All of a sudden, you have been given the authority to raise people from the dead. Or your sick relative, who you care very much about, you can now go, and you can, with, in Jesus' name, bring healing to those who are sick. I mean, they must have felt absolutely invincible. I mean, seriously. Like, if you had that power, okay, first of all, you'd probably be standing up here, but second, you would have a very difficult time sort of restraining yourself, I would imagine. 

Restraining yourself from using that power, restraining yourself from thinking, "Man, I can do anything. I mean, I have the authority of Jesus to proclaim this awesome message, and I have this awesome authority to do these things that nobody else can possibly do. I am invincible." And Jesus says, "No, you're not. Let me tell you what it's going to be like."

It says the first reason why you need to beware is because you are sheep. Remember what you are. As Jesus continues to speak in the text today, it becomes clear that this message, which seems sort of temporary, like "Go around to the towns," it sort of expands out to like a broader vision of where all this is going. And so Jesus turns to metaphors, and He includes the Gentiles now, and He speaks about a future, sort of like, you know, this is only the beginning. He starts off, "This is only the beginning. Let me tell you what it's going to be like for you," which, by the way, is 100% accurate in all of their lives. He says, "Let me tell you what it's going to be like. You are sheep, and you're in the midst of wolves." 

That's not a very hopeful picture, is it? We really do have to reform some of our evangelism manuals. You know, "You are a sheep, and you are in the midst of wolves," He says. That's not hopeful; that's a very dangerous picture. He says, "It's dangerous. And so you need to be sheep who are wise like serpents and innocent like doves." An interesting combination. Wise like serpents. You need to be shrewd. You need to be a little hesitant to trust everybody who you come into contact with. You need to be a little shrewd. Wise. But you also got to be innocent like doves. 

Now, you know, my namesake, great. When you look at these poor birds, I don't know if innocent would necessarily be the word that you could use, but everything else—the hawks come, and every other bird clears out of the place. Except for the doves. They're such easy pickings. They're so easy pickings. They're so innocent. It's the idea that they're just vulnerable. They're absolutely vulnerable for the sake of the gospel. 

Is the picture that Jesus has drawn. You have to be both. You have to be wise and shrewd and not just trust everybody all the time. And at the same time, you have to be willing to just be damaged for the gospel. You have to be willing to be vulnerable. That hasn't changed. We can't become, as Christians, cynical because people sin against us and because we become so cynical at what's happened to us that we just stop laboring among God's people. And we also ought not to fully entrust ourselves to other people as if everybody's always on our side and that there will be no opposition and it's just too happy to be a Christian. 

We trust in Christ, and we go about His work, and we beware. Because, you see, Jesus says there's some men out there. Beware of men because this is what they're going to do. They're going to deliver you over to the courts, and then they're going to flog you in the synagogues. And then they're going to drag you before governors and kings. And then they're going to put you to death. And not only that, they're going to hate you. Remember that marvelous, glorious gospel? They're going to hate you because of it. Because of my name. 

It's going to be the civic leaders, the governors, and the kings. It's going to be the religious leaders, those in the synagogues. And then it's even going to be your family members. Brother against brother, father against child, children rising up against their parents. We live in a country where we are able to worship freely. And so sometimes texts like this, we read like that, and they're like, "What?" If the Lord chose to place any of us in, say, a communist country in the '50s or '60s—1950s, 1960s, and so on—up until today, we would not be worshiping freely. It would be illegal. For the name of Christ, you could be dragged before the court. If you, and many have, came from a Muslim background and you were converted to Christianity for the name of Jesus, and you lived in a predominantly Muslim country, if that was the Lord's story in your life, then you might be persecuted not only by the civil authorities if they found out that you converted to Christianity because that's illegal, or the religious authorities who might be after you to kill you for doing that, but then your own family members might actually turn you in to be killed. 

That's Jesus' environment. He's saying, "The message that I'm going to bring, that I am the king, isn't going to go over very well in a Roman Empire where the emperor is the king. And it's not going to go over very well among the Jew in the Jewish synagogues where you're going to be persecuted because they don't believe I'm the Messiah and because they're into their own power. You're going to be hated for the name of Christ." And so Jesus says, "So you've got to be wise like serpents. You've got to know when to run." I love it. He says, "If you get a sense of danger, just run away." Like, don't volunteer to be a martyr for Jesus. Live to preach another day. Go to another city. And then He says, "Then you've got to be innocent. If you're dragged into court, which is probably going to happen, then let the Lord, through His Spirit, do the speaking for you. You don't have to plan everything that you're going to say. He's going to give you the words to say when you need them."

You know, the message that one day in a culture, say like ours, that might be able to be received joyfully, that same message may one day be considered bigotry. And the message that might be embraced in one area of the world and in another as okay, preaching that same message in a different area might be considered a crime worthy of imprisonment. Understand, Jesus' warning here was beware. He's talking

 to these specific men, but He's also saying as a principle, beware. This world is not just a "Wow, this is just a..." I mean, we have been blessed. We have been blessed. To worship freely like this is such a blessing. And yet, there is nothing that guarantees that ten years from now we would be in the exact same place. Nothing, absolutely nothing. 

And so we are wary, wise as serpents, innocent as doves. We must be ready in this world to live for Christ. We must be ready to die for Christ. We must be ready to suffer for Christ. The world is full of troubles, full of enemies. We must beware. At the same time, we must take heart, for Jesus has overcome the world. And so we endure. You know, there's a lot of things you just need to finish and seem like they never will finish. You probably have a project that, you know, maybe your spouse has said to you, "When are you going to finish that project?" And you believe that you've been working on it real hard. It's just been seven years, that's all. And so there's those projects. Maybe you have those in your own mind. You know, one day I want to learn how to do X. And you begin to do that work, and you find out, boy, this is just kind of hard, and it sort of, you know, slips to the side. But one day I'm going to get back to learning how to do X. You might have a long-term project like that.

Some of you, I'm sure, have run races before. Maybe you've run long races like a marathon or something, and you get that sense of you just got to kind of keep going. But here is a universal one, and all of you who are older here know this truth: that life is long. I mean, I know life is short, but life is also long. Some days it goes really well. And some days you just need to get through till the next day. You've got to just keep going. The word "to endure" means to lift up, to always be under something lifting it up. Okay, so you're always bearing up under the weight of something. And enduring always means that it's going to be difficult. In the midst of opposition, which Jesus says here is constant, we're called then to bear up under it all, to endure. 

Jesus calls the disciples to endure it. How long? How long must you endure? To the end. That's what He says. That's how long. You must endure to the end. The one who endures to the end will be saved. You know, I think of one of the great switches that happens in the story of the Exodus when they come into the Promised Land versus this story here of what happens when Jesus, when the King comes. When they're heading to the Promised Land, you might remember that Moses sends a bunch of spies in. And of the spies, only two of them come back with like, "Yes, you should trust God." And ten of them are just like, "No, run away," you know, "Things were better in Egypt," and all that kind of bad business. Now Jesus comes, and what's really remarkable is that we no longer have it like that. Of the twelve, eleven endured all the way to the end. It should give us a great deal of hope that He's going to help us do the same thing. One betrayed Him. Eleven endured all the way to the end.

The twelve were initially sent on a short mission, but it would expand into a greater mission, one which they wouldn't finish before the Son of Man comes, the Bible says. This mission of preaching to the Jews, to the lost sheep of Israel. When does the Son of Man come? Well, of course, as you can imagine, there's a ton of discussion there because as you read that and as I read that, everybody's like, "What does that mean?" And so people are all over the place with that, but largely what it comes down to is it likely means either at the resurrection or the ascension or the pouring out of the Spirit or maybe even the judgment on Jerusalem in AD 70. But like, sort of like this idea, the idea is that Jesus is saying there are way too many towns and there's not enough laborers or time to go to all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes, before this time.

Let me summarize it even further by using this phrase: There is always more to do. There are more towns to reach. There are more nations to bring the gospel to. There are more people who need salvation. There are more deeds of love and more deeds of mercy and more deeds of kindness to be carried out. There are more children to bear and more children to raise. There are more elderly who need to be taken care of. There is labor for the laborers, and so we do that. And we do that until the Son of Man comes again. And when He does, the labor will be over. But until that great day, we are called as His disciples to do what He calls the twelve to do, and that is to endure. To bear the load all the way until the end. And the load can be heavy. But He says we bear it all the way until the end.

And He doesn't tell you to do something that He didn't do Himself. This is what the writer of the Hebrews says. He says, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely. Lay aside that burden. And let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who, for the joy that was set before Him, endured the cross. Despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God, consider Him who endured from sinners such hostility against Himself so that you may not grow weary or faint-hearted."

Christ endured the cross for you. Christ endured hostility against Himself from sinful men that you might be saved. And He calls us then to endure. Brothers and sisters in Christ, disciples of Jesus, those of you who are, don't grow weary. Don't grow faint-hearted. Go into the world as salt and light, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. Beware. There's real opposition. The way is hard that leads to life. And endure. Run the race He has laid out for you and run it all the way to the end, for the one who endures to the end will be saved. Christ has promised this, and He will surely do it.

Let's pray. 

Father in heaven, we're grateful for those who came in the name of Jesus and with His authority to share the gospel with us. And we pray that you would pour out your Spirit on your people and strengthen us to go into the world as salt and light, proclaiming and faithfully living out the gospel of Jesus. Help us to be wise and innocent, to beware of the dangers and opposition that we will certainly face from the world, the flesh, and the devil. And help us by your grace to endure, to run the race that has been set before us, to keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. And it's in the name of Jesus that we pray these things. Amen.
