Good morning. You can turn with me this morning to Matthew chapter 20. If you're visiting with us today, we have been walking through this Gospel as a congregation. The Gospel of Matthew is the story of Jesus—his works and his words—and there's a lot going on in the section we're now in and have been looking at for the last couple of months.

There's this underlying question being asked by Jesus' disciples: what does it mean to be great in the kingdom of God? Jesus has tackled this question in a variety of ways. There's kind of a back and forth. First, he speaks some very difficult, pointed words to hard-hearted Pharisees and religious leaders. Then, in the very next scene, he welcomes little children to bless them. Next, a very respectable, wealthy young synagogue ruler comes to Jesus and interacts with him. Jesus calls him to commitment, but the commitment is such that the man, because he is wealthy, turns away from Jesus. Then, in the very next section, Jesus tells a parable that concludes with him saying, "Many who are first, like this rich young ruler, will be last, and the last first."

Last week, two of his disciples, James and John, through their mother, approached Jesus and asked him for positions of authority and greatness in his kingdom. Jesus rejects this request, commenting that it isn't even for him to give. Today, we see the other side. Instead of disciples seeking thrones, we meet two blind men who also have a request.

This passage kicks off a month of reflection for us on the coming of Jesus into the world as we celebrate Advent together. We'll look at this text today and then delve deeper in the weeks ahead, considering our need for mercy, Jesus as the Son of David, and what that means, culminating with the birth of Jesus as King.

As we come to today's passage, we see Jesus continuing his ascent to Jerusalem for the Passover feast. This week-long event drew people from all over Israel. The roads would have been packed with pilgrims. Jesus is traveling with a large group—mostly his disciples, their families, and others from Galilee—all heading to Jerusalem. Ultimately, Jesus is heading to the cross. This is near the end of his life. The last city on the way to Jerusalem is Jericho, about 15 miles away—a day's journey from where his arrest, crucifixion, and resurrection will occur. So he's very close. In the midst of this large crowd, as they approach Jericho, Jesus hears a noise from the side of the road. 

Let’s read Matthew 20, beginning at verse 29:  

> "And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside. And when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, 'Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!' The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, 'Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!' And stopping, Jesus called them and said, 'What do you want me to do for you?' They said to him, 'Lord, let our eyes be opened.' And Jesus, in pity, touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him."

This is the Word of the Lord.

You've probably been in a crowd before, trying to make contact with someone—at a parade, a sports event, or maybe an airport. You don't want to make a scene, so you wave subtly, hoping the person notices you. Sometimes, you might see someone waving in your direction, and your mind races: "Do I know them? Should I wave back?" 

Why are we hesitant? Often, it’s because we don’t want to draw too much attention or risk embarrassment.  

Contrast that with these two blind men. They were determined that Jesus would know they wanted to meet him.  

First, note that they were poor. The passage says they were sitting by the roadside, likely begging. It was feast time—a good opportunity for alms, as many people were traveling. Hearing that Jesus was passing by, they sprang into action.  

They were also pitiable. We don’t know how they became blind—whether from birth or later in life—but their blindness rendered them utterly dependent on others. They couldn’t work, only beg. Yet, their pitiable state didn’t stop them.  

They were persevering. Amid the clamor, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” The crowd rebuked them, but they cried out all the more. 

And then, an amazing thing happened: **Jesus stopped.**

Imagine this: Jesus, the Son of God, is on his way to accomplish the most important mission in history—yet he stops for these two blind beggars.  

If you feel burdened by sin, loneliness, or suffering, take heart: Jesus stops for you too. He doesn’t push you away. When you cry out to him, he listens.  

Not only does Jesus stop, but he calls them to himself, asking, “What do you want me to do for you?” Their answer is simple: “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”  

Unlike James and John, who sought thrones, these men sought mercy. They recognized their utter dependence on Jesus.  

Jesus, moved by pity, touched their eyes. Immediately, they received their sight—and followed him.

This story illustrates the compassion, presence, and power of Christ. Jesus doesn’t see us as problems to be solved but as people in need of love. He is intimately present, touching lives and transforming hearts.  

The blind men didn’t just regain their physical sight—they gained spiritual sight. Recognizing Jesus as the Messiah, they chose to follow him.  

What about you? Will you cry out to Jesus, recognizing your need for him? Will you respond to his call and follow him?  

May we, like these blind men, cry out for mercy, receive his healing touch, and follow him all our days. **Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now am found; was blind, but now I see.**  

Let’s pray.
