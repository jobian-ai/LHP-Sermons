I don't think it's bird. I don't think it's a bug. I think it's exactly what a UFO stands for, unidentified flying object.

We did discover and explore many, many things in ways that frankly at the beginning look almost like a miracle. And then as we go forward, it looks like something new we never would have guessed.

Oh, come here! Unexplained sightings of flying objects in the sky for decades. The space agency launching a new team to investigate who or what may be behind the unexplained site.

Just last month, this video shot on an iPhone during an air show in Miami appears to show something shooting up out of the water with people swimming nearby.

Of unidentified aerial phenomena, UAP, or what we all call unidentified flying objects.

When I saw it, I was like, what in the, like no way!

Check on 613, I'll take off. Like a thot. Look at all this.

You will listen to an alien revelation, the history of UFO disclosure. This is Episode Two, The Sorcerer and the Seer.

Oh my gosh, dude. Wow! He's crying.

# PODCAST TEXT

The story of modern UFOs and the UFO disclosure movement actually begins in the strangest of places. It begins in the court of Queen Elizabeth I with one of her advisors, an enigmatic figure named John Dee.

So who was John Dee? Well, John Dee was an accomplished mathematician, an accomplished astronomer, and a prolific occultist, hence why I've dubbed him the Sorcerer in the history of UFO disclosure.

Now his official position within Queen Elizabeth's court was as an astronomer and as a personal advisor to the Queen. In fact, many have actually tied John Dee to what can be considered an early iteration of British intelligence. That's because there's very good reason to assume that when Dee traveled overseas that he functioned as a spy of sorts for Queen Elizabeth's court. In fact, it's well known that John Dee actually had a three-letter code to identify himself in his correspondences with Queen Elizabeth, which was, you guessed it, 007.

But wait a minute, isn't that James Bond's number? Bond. James Bond. Well, yes, but you see Ian Fleming, the creator of the James Bond franchise, gave his fictional character that number in tribute to John Dee.

But we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here. You see, John Dee is significant to our subject for a number of reasons. First, Dee wasn't just some obscure court magician of little to no repertoire. On the contrary, Dee has been recognized by historians as having invented the concept of a that is projected around the world through naval force, a concept that he not only reportedly received from the angels whom he claimed he was in contact with, specifically from an entity that he identified as the Archangel Michael, but that concept of a British empire projected through naval force is one that has deeply affected the flow of history, even our history as the United States. And if America is seen as continuing the legacy of the British empire as many have surmised, then it's a concept that is alive and well today.

So you see, Dee is no minor figure in world history, but he's also no minor figure in the history of the occult. You see, Dee lived in that era between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment when the best and the brightest still believed in contact with the spirit world. In fact, the best and the brightest often tried to contact the spirit world looking for inspiration as they developed new theories in the realm of science and mathematics. And this was certainly true of John Dee.

You see, aside from Dee's contact with royalty and with the elites of his day, Dee was also famous for his work. Dee was also famous for engaging in quote, spiritual conferences with entities that identified themselves as angels.

Now from what we know, the majority of these conferences began in 1582 when a man named John Kelly who was impressed with Dee and his abilities and his intellect encouraged him to join with him and to engage in regular crystal gazing together, a practice that is known as scrying. This is where an occult practitioner will put themselves into a trance of sorts while gazing at a crystal ball seeking to induce visions of the other side. If you've ever seen the Wizard of Oz, you know what I'm talking about.

We can't do these things without reaching out into the infinite.

Yes, that's all right. Now you can open them. We'll gaze into the crystal.

And with Dee and Kelly, this act of scrying was a deeply religious ritual to them and it was one that was infused with Anglican spirituality and with things like fasting and praying and even chanting of the Psalms similar to what we opened up with.

But what Dee would learn through these conferences with the angels was rather striking. First, the angels would claim to reveal to both him and Kelly the original language of mankind known as the Enochian language. They would also claim to lay the groundwork for a form of contact with themselves which has been dubbed Enochian magic after the biblical patriarch Enoch.

But what was particularly interesting about these so-called angels is that they would rail against the reformation for having broken up Christendom and they were insistent that human beings had so screwed everything up that God was now handing humanity's fate over to the angels who would guide mankind into a more glorious future.

They would claim to be instituting a new ecumenical Christian religion which was a fusion of Protestantism with esoteric philosophy and with angelic contact. And in their vision they thought that it would be centered on this British empire that would be projected around the world through naval power which if you think about it is interesting in light of all the recent buzz about naval encounters especially with UFOs or UAPs.

So the angels claimed to be laying the groundwork for a new global empire with a new global religion and all of this came about through a magician who served on the court of an English queen who was also known for promoting Protestantism but who also seemed to have another agenda driving her at times.

And while Elizabeth's chief ecclesiastical opponents known as the Puritans would have opposed Dee if they had been aware of what he was up to, Elizabeth's successor King James I, the name the King James Bible is named after, he went on a campaign against witchcraft and the occult during his reign.

In fact as occult researcher Jason Louv says in his work on John Dee, Ben Johnson's play The Alchemist, which was written in 1610 just a year before the King James Bible was published, the play was inspired by Dee's legend. The respective sorcerer in the play who is based off of Dee is presented as being the tragic victim of his own ambitions. As he says, even the traditional cartoon image we inherit of the wizard figure wearing a star covered cap and robe and wielding a crystal ball suggests a survival of caricatures of Dee. Think for example of Gandalf and Dumbledore in popular culture.

But what Dee would really be known for going forward is a new system of western magic which involved mathematics and occult practices that would be used to achieve enlightenment through contact with higher entities that he identified as angels. In many ways Dee argued for a fusion of science and occultism which again was typical for Renaissance era thinkers.

As many historians and occult researchers have noted, the Rosicrucian order was most likely inspired by John Dee. For those of you who aren't familiar with the order, Rosicrucianism is the order of the Rosy Cross. As cult and occult researcher Dr. Walter Martin describes it in his book The Kingdom of the Cults, Rosicrucianism flourished in a day when secret societies were in vogue and a century after its origin, Rosicrucianism underwent a transformation in connection with Freemasonry. In other words, Rosicrucianism was a Renaissance era secret society much like the Freemasons which in some areas probably evolved into what is now called speculative Freemasonry.

Now some historians like Dame Yates argue rather convincingly that Dee formed proto-Rosicrucian groups while he was in Bohemia. Dr. Yates demonstrates that Dee's fingerprints can be found all over the movement as it sprung up in the early 17th century.

However, a direct connection can be drawn between Dee and Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry through a man named Elias Ashmoul, a man who was instrumental in turning modern Freemasonry from being a mere masons guild or a trade union into becoming the esoteric society that it's now known as. And like Dee, Ashmoul was a supporter of the British crown. He supported King Charles I, the enemy of the Puritans and Presbyterians in the English Civil War, and he was most likely a court advisor to King Charles II, an even worse enemy of the Puritans and the Covenanters.

But Ashmoul is significant in connecting Rosicrucianism and how it would evolve into Freemasonry with John Dee because Ashmoul famously purchased the original copies of John Dee's spirit diaries from a collector and he was deeply impressed by them and influenced by them.

But Rosicrucianism, like John Dee, sought to fuse occultism and alchemy with scientific discovery in order to bring about an era of enlightenment and utopia to mankind. And the reason why they operated in secret was to shield their ideas from interference from both the ecclesiastical establishment and the scientific establishment as they sought to slowly permeate the culture with their ideas. This is why the Rosicrucians were also dubbed the quote, invisible college because they were an invisible college of scientific occultists who were seeking to advance mankind incognito through this fusion of science and occultism.

But for our purposes in this podcast, what's particularly interesting is that as many UFO researchers have noted, the group of scientists and researchers and government employees who have been pushing for UFO disclosure for the past decade who have been working with men like Tom DeLonge, they are referred to, you got it, as the invisible college. This was a term coined by one of the most respected voices in the realm of ufology, astronomer and computer scientist Dr. Jacques Vallee who authored a book entitled The Invisible College in the 1970s.

And so again as many UFO researchers have pointed out, it appears as if there's a clear connection between John Dee and the Rosicrucians and this modern push for UFO research and UFO disclosure and the fusion of occultism and scientific advancement that is inherent to the subject of UFOs.

In fact, Dr. Diana Posolka, whom I briefly mentioned in the previous podcast and who is a friend of Jacques Vallee and other members of the invisible college, she implied such a link at a lecture she gave at Rice University.

Members of the 17th century invisible college also dabbled in or probably initiates of the order of the Rose Cross or the Rosy Cross, also known as the esoteric tradition of Rosicrucians. Esotericism refers to a true, I think we all know what it is but I'm going to say it anyway, it refers to a tradition of knowledge, production and transmission that is focused on truths that are hidden. So it's a tradition of hidden knowledge.

Who are the Rosicrucians? Members of this order attempt to align themselves with what they deem important and perennial truths and from what I can surmise, they surf while at the same time study a time wave that seems to have a life of its own, its own autonomy, like the Tao. A tenet of this order is that this knowledge is democratically available to all who have the inclination, inspiration and capacity to study it. It does not discriminate with respect to money, credentials or insider information.

Okay, more on that in future episodes. And to be clear, Dr. Pasulka does tie the Rosicrucians and the invisible college to those members of the intelligence agencies and scientists working with NASA who are currently studying the UFO phenomenon in modern times and that's a subject that we will cover on future episodes. But in light of this time wave that she refers to, Dee's vision of a British empire projected through naval force which he received through angelic revelation, a vision that would come true would certainly seem to be in line with this belief that members of the invisible college have that they are riding or surfing a time wave of sorts.

But apart from secret societies like the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons, Dee's influence would be pervasive in the realm of the occult and scientific research in the centuries ahead. For example, famous black magicians like Aleister Crowley would openly engage with his system of Enochian magic as Crowley received that system from the order of the Golden Dawn. In fact, many occult practitioners and researchers like Jason Louve have noted that Aleister Crowley simply took Dee's system and inverted it, which is a typical practice of black magicians.

One of Crowley's disciples, another man named Jack Parsons, who would go on to found NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a man we will consider in our next episode, he would be an avid practitioner of Dee's system and he would regularly commune with beings in the deserts of California whom he would credit with guiding his research into rocket science. So again, there you see this fusion of science and occultism.

Another figure named L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction author and soon to be cult leader, would join Jack Parsons in the desert in his pursuit of Crowleyian Enochian magic.

So think about that. A medieval court magician who contacted angels, who said that they would guide humanity into a new age of ecumenical religion and occultism. He started a form of magic and occultism that has been passed down through secret orders to men whose works have deeply affected everything from the space race to the nuclear weapons race and to the goings on of Hollywood, again thinking of the cult of Scientology that L. Ron Hubbard started.

And as we continue to press forward towards UFO disclosure, it continues to be men who are deeply affected by these streams that are involved with modern ufology and UFO disclosure. Jacques Vallee, who coined the term the invisible college in reference to the academics and government workers who study the UFO phenomenon, he was at one point a Rosicrucian, although now he is a relatively devout Roman Catholic.

Physicist Hal Puthoff, who works with Tom DeLonge's To The Stars and who continues to hold multiple TSSCI clearances with the government, was not only once an accomplished Scientologist, the creation of a practitioner of Dee's magic as mediated by Aleister Crowley, but he is also recognized as a member of the invisible college.

Tom DeLonge himself, who has hired men like Hal Puthoff and consulted with men like Jacques Vallee, refers to Dee multiple times in his works on UFOs and UFO disclosure. In fact, in his second non-fiction book, Tom DeLonge and his co-author, occult researcher Peter Levenda, observed that the angelic tablet devised by Dee was quote, used for communication with extraterrestrial beings.

This is a stunning admission from one of the foremost UFO disclosure activists that contact with UFOs and UAPs is indeed rooted in the sorcery of John Dee.

But you see, it wasn't simply secret societies and occult groups that sought out contact with otherworldly beings. In the post-Reformation era, several well-known cult religions would also claim to be rooted in angelic contact and in an ever-expanding view of the universe. One such movement that would lay the groundwork for several other movements was known as Swedenborgianism.

Now, Swedenborgianism is named after a man named Emanuel Swedenborg who lived from 1688 to 1722. He was born in the period where the Renaissance was coming to a close and where what we now call the Enlightenment was beginning its ascent. This was an era after the heyday of the Rosicrucians and the invisible college. In fact, men who were involved with the invisible college would go on to form the British Royal Society of Scientific Research in 1660 and would slowly divorce scientific research from the realms of alchemy and the occult, at least publicly. Thus introducing an era of societal advancement based around rationalism and empiricism and materialism which had the effect of driving the occult underground.

And while contact with angels and occult practices would be publicly distanced from the realm of scientific discovery, it would continue to be an obsession with those who openly engaged with the realms of religion and spirituality. Of course, the New England Puritans would engage in witch trials at the end of the 17th century out of the firm conviction that the spirit realm continued to interact tangibly with the physical realm. Even Puritan leaders like Cotton Mather, who was a member of the British Royal Society and an advocate for scientific advancement, still believe that this world is interpenetrated with the wonders of the invisible realm, to quote the title of his famous book.

But apart from simply believing that such a realm is there, many popular teachers openly sought contact with the spirit realm and they openly sought to fuse such contact with Christian spirituality. This is where Emanuel Swedenborg comes into the picture.

Now Swedenborg was the son of a noted Lutheran minister who was also serving as a court chaplain to the King of Sweden. So there you see that this stuff is being mixed with the courts of power. He would later go on to become a professor and then the dean of the University of Uppsala. And like John Dee, he blended Christian spirituality and angelic and occult contact with a vision for scientific advancement for the betterment of society.

As Dr. Walter Martin says in Kingdom of the Cults, Swedenborg invented everything from a new stove to a magazine air gun, methods of salt manufacture, and he even drew plans for a flying machine and the construction of docks. He also seemed to have come up with the idea of a combat submarine along with writing several books about mathematics and navigation.

But what he is especially known for is his reported call to be a seer in 1745. In 1745 he claimed to have received a divine summons to be both a seer and a revealer of the spiritual world and of the deeper symbolic meaning of scripture. This calling would involve revelations that were given to him in the form of automatic writing and clairvoyance. Many of those who knew Swedenborg attested to his abilities to perceive events from afar, including the Stockholm fire of 1759.

And as to be expected, he began to reformulate the doctrine of the Trinity, the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and the doctrine of the afterlife in a way that was far from Christian orthodoxy.

But again, for our purposes here in this podcast, what was noteworthy about Emanuel Swedenborg was that while he claimed to have contact with the spirit world, he also claimed to have contact with beings from other planets, something that even John Dee couldn't envision in his day. In 1758 he published a book entitled, Life on Other Planets, where through the assistance of an angel, he claimed to have traveled to Mercury, Mars, Venus, and the Moon and to have spoken to beings on those planets.

This would introduce into the social imaginary, as Charles Taylor calls it, the idea that not only is there life on other planets, but that such life might be tied in with how we might rethink and reformulate doctrines about God, creation, and the plan of salvation.

And while you might be tempted to think that such extreme ideas would be written off by the intelligentsia of the day, like with John Dee, those with cultural and intellectual power were drawn to Swedenborg and were drawn to Swedenborgianism. The philosopher Emanuel Kant even acknowledged Swedenborg's influence in his work, Dreams of the Spirit Seer. Other famous Swedenborgians would include Johnny Appleseed, who was a Swedenborgian missionary, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Helen Keller.

Even the famous German Reformed theologian, John Williamson Nevin, would write approvingly of Swedenborgianism toward the end of his life, though some would claim it was just a mere side interest that he would later back away from.

But aside from those who directly followed the movement, Swedenborg's ideas about God, the afterlife, and life on other planets would deeply affect the social imaginary of European thought after the 18th century. Men like Benjamin Franklin and other Founding Fathers believed in the doctrine of the plurality of worlds and that life on other planets was part of God's design and part of his plan for moral advancement in his universe, as articulated by Deism.

But perhaps the most well-known figure who appears to have been influenced by Swedenborgian ideas was Joseph Smith. You see, like Swedenborg, Joseph Smith held to a plurality of worlds inhabited by intelligent life just like us. And like Swedenborg, Joseph Smith taught that there were three heavens or three degrees of glory, a central tenet of Mormonism.

And the influence of Swedenborg and his ideas continues into our day. While most Americans are not directly influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg, and while Mormonism is still a minority religion, the ideas taught by both of these movements have deeply affected how the average person thinks about God, the universe, and man's place in the universe.

There's a reason why people often mockingly compare Mormonism to science fiction literature and to science fiction films. It's because the ideas that are contained in Mormonism do indeed permeate popular culture through the genre of science fiction.

And as it appears at least that we are moving towards some sort of disclosure about UFOs, many have the sense that science fiction, along with some of the more strange ideas that have cropped up in Western civilization in the past few hundred years, these might all become scientific fact very soon.

So a sorcerer and a seer who claim contact with beings from other worlds, who advanced civilization and the progress of knowledge, who both claim to be Christians, and who both deeply influenced cultural movers and shakers going forward. What's a Christian to make of this?

Well, we have to recognize, first and foremost, occultism and contact with the spirit world are condemned by the Holy Scriptures. In Leviticus chapter 19 and verse 31, God said to the children of Israel,

"Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out, and so make yourselves unclean by them: I am the Lord your God."

And yet over and over in the Old Testament, we see that the people of God were tempted to blend the religion of Jehovah with occultism and with spirit contact. Think of King Saul and the Witch of Endor.

So also in the New Testament, Jesus warns us that there will be false teachers and false prophets who will be raised up. Even Paul in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 14, he warns that the devil can transform himself into an angel of light.

And at the beginning of the book of Galatians, he seems to imply that fallen angelic powers may want to inspire false religions and false gospels. In Galatians chapter 1 and verse 8, he says,

"But even if we, that is the apostles, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed."

So the Bible warns us about this kind of stuff. And the Bible does imply in many places that the angels, that even the fallen angels, possess great knowledge and great wisdom and great power which they can share with men while performing great signs and wonders to men, of course, as they are permitted to do so by the providence of God.

And as Christian thinkers like Gary North point out in his book Unholy Spirits, it's especially when cultures are going through a great paradigm shift. Especially when human beings are rethinking what is and isn't possible based upon the attainment of new knowledge. It's especially then that they go looking for answers and direction in the realm of the occult and through spirit contact.

The idea is that as man is dealing with a world that is showing itself to be far beyond his comprehension, he looks for guidance and direction and even insight from higher entities. And that was certainly the case during the Renaissance with men like John Dee.

And yet as Christians, we thank God that the Scriptures are sufficient. The Bible gives us a world and life view that makes sense of the wonders of science and that makes sense of the wonders of the invisible world while keeping us grounded in Christ in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid.

And in Christ, we can have confidence because he has triumphed over the fallen angelic powers through his crucifixion and resurrection. And so we need not fear the fallen angelic powers nor be overly intrigued by them so that we go seeking hidden wisdom and knowledge from them. No, indeed in Christ who is God in the flesh who died for our sins and who was raised to justify us before God, in him we have the only so-called otherworldly contact that matters. Union and communion with the triune God.

But in our next episode, we are going to examine a rocket scientist who continued on this path, who sought out contact with the same spirits that John Dee and others have sought out, and who claimed to have been guided by them to develop the modern rocket. And as we will see, this is tied in with the saucer fever that gripped our nation immediately after World War II.

That's coming up in episode 3 where we will examine occult rocketry, a grimoire of the space race.
