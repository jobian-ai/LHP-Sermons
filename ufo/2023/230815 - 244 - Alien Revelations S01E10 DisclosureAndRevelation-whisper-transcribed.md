I don't think it's bird. I don't think it's a bug. I think it's exactly what a UFO stands for, unidentified flying object.

We did discover and explore many, many things in ways that, frankly, at the beginning, look almost like a miracle. And then as we go forward, it looks like something new we never would have guessed.

Hey, Johnny! Unexplained sightings of flying objects in the sky for decades, the space agency launching a new team to investigate who or what may be behind the unexplained site.

Just last month, this video shot on an iPhone during an air show in Miami appears to show something shooting up out of the water with people swimming nearby.

Of unidentified aerial phenomena, UAP, or what we all call unidentified flying objects.

And I saw it, and I was like, what in the... Like, no way!

Check on 6-1-10. Roger. I get by. Come on, take it!

Listening to an alien revelation, the history of UFO disclosure. This is Episode 10, Disclosure and Revelation.

Look out! Oh, my God! Wow! Oh, my God! He's flying!

# INTRO

Throughout this series, we have seen examined not only the history of belief in UFOs, along with the history of the push to disclose whatever the government might know about these things, but we have also examined the world views and the presuppositions at play amongst those involved with the UFO phenomenon and the push for disclosure.

And along the way, we have considered how a Christian might understand these things and how a Christian might interact with these subjects.

So, as we now come to our final episode, we are going to spend our time considering the nature of the phenomenon, as well as the various interpretations that have been offered of the phenomenon, while also considering what the Christian worldview might have to say about these things.

And again, this is something that Christians are going to have to continue to wrestle with as the push for disclosure is going to continue to advance in the months and years ahead, at least if nothing changes from the present course that we are on.

And just as a heads up, this episode will be a slightly longer episode, as we have a lot to tie together and wrap up, and so I ask you to bear with me, as my hope is that this episode will function as a roadmap going forward in how to understand this subject specifically from a Christian worldview perspective.

In fact, as I'm recording this episode, it's been announced that the House Oversight Committee is going to be doing a full hearing on the subject of UFOs, and possibly the Senate will as well, and this will focus on the allegations of David Grush, as well as other whistleblowers who have allegedly come forward.

Grush himself will apparently be testifying under oath, again, along with other witnesses and whistleblowers, or at least that's the current plan.

In other words, the credible individuals who have been coming forward in the past years, some of whom I've mentioned in this series, they will be asked to tell what they know to lawmakers under the penalty of perjury.

So again, if everything goes according to plan, this will not be just a matter of time. This will be just another hearing where some bureaucrat from the Pentagon gives non-answers while placating the American people.

No, instead, members of Congress may get information and evidence that they can then take to the gatekeepers and to the bureaucrats and place them under oath in future hearings about how they might respond to the allegations of these whistleblowers.

And with that, we are likely, either way, to see more references to the phenomenon in books and in movies, while the intelligentsia of our culture and academia also continue to take this subject more and more seriously.

And as we have seen in this series, all of this has been building for the last few years, backed up by momentum that's been building since the 1940s, undergirded by a general worldview that has been emerging for centuries.

And again, as we have seen, that worldview is a mixture of science and occultism, though it often oscillates between the two, with a view towards a cosmic, pluralistic perspective, or to a perspective where it's understood that there are intelligences other than God who can guide us into peace, prosperity, deeper spirituality, and perhaps even salvation.

One can hear the echoes in this emerging perspective of John Dee's angels who claimed that they were taking control of the human race in order to perfect man and bring him into a higher state of being.

And again, disclosure holds out the hope of being the final unveiling, where mankind will be empowered to enter into this higher state, into a world of cosmic, pluralistic spirituality, with all of the beings and intelligences that might be out there.

But before we analyze this worldview and the phenomenon that seems to undergird it and legitimize it, let's first define the word disclosure.

Of course, disclosure has been a word that I've used in context throughout this series, so I'm sure that with many of you, you grasp the general tenet that it has to do with the unveiling of the UFO phenomenon as being undoubtedly real and perhaps related, again, to the general worldview perspective that I just outlined.

However, to be more precise, I agree with the definition given by Ryan Robbins from the popular Post-Disclosure World podcast as to what disclosure is. He defines it as, quote, Once world institutions, except unaccounted for machines, more advanced than anything any military inventory has, are traversing our atmosphere, we've entered a post-disclosure world.

And world institutions there includes the media, academia, and the various branches of government around the world.

And note that Ryan's definition doesn't necessarily include a My Fellow American speech from the president, nor does it require bodies and crafts to be rolled out for inspection by the National Academy of Sciences and the New York Times.

It doesn't even require a definitive conclusion as to who is behind the wheel of UFOs and UAPs.

It simply involves the acknowledgement and acceptance by world institutions that the phenomenon is real and that it's not a product of illusions, delusions, hoaxes, or other human activity.

And as Luis Elizondo and others have observed, if we go with a definition similar to Ryan's from the Post-Disclosure podcast, then disclosure happened in 2017, though it took time for that story to build and to be acknowledged as credible by many of our trusted institutions.

And that credibility is continuing to be acknowledged into our present day.

And it's likely to continue to build in momentum because this subject tends to spark the curiosity of most of the world's population, though most people are usually ashamed to admit it.

And yet, the disclosure process is slowly beginning to minimize the stigma surrounding this subject so that more and more people and institutions can openly acknowledge their interest in it and begin to then study it.

Think back to the members of UFO Fight Club who all went under pseudonyms in Dr. Diana Pisolka's book. And yet now they are able to openly identify themselves and communicate their interest and findings to the media and to the wider world of academia.

In other words, the curtain is slowly being drawn back on the secret of UFOs and UAPs, and more and more people are beginning to focus on what's about to be unveiled on center stage.

And this is interesting because the word disclosure actually means to draw back the curtain.

In fact, the word revelation in the Bible, whether it comes from the word apocalyptic in Greek or the Hebrew word, gala in the Old Testament, either one of those words that we translate to revelation in English is tied to the concept of an unveiling.

Gala literally means to disrobe or to uncover, whereas again, apocalyptic, the Greek word, can be conceptually tied to drawing back the curtain at a stage play.

And this is significant to point out because the concept of revelation or divine disclosure lies at the very core of religion.

Mankind cannot have religion apart from revelation, whether it be true religion or false religion.

And the UFO subject, especially as it's been incarnated and the cultural push for disclosure or an unveiling, is taken upon this same religious mystique.

Hence why I have named this podcast An Alien Revelation, a History of UFO Disclosure.

As we have repeatedly seen, the early iterations of UFO religion and this cosmic pluralistic spirituality, as I have dubbed it, it was originally tied to occult practitioners and to heretical theologians.

So also, as we have seen, when everyday people are confronted with the UFO phenomenon, whether it be through personal encounters or through information coming out in the media, they often find themselves being awakened from their dogmatic slumber of materialism, and they usually then go searching for answers in the realm of philosophy and religion, while sometimes becoming obsessed with the UFO subject and other paranormal topics.

In other words, UFOs and UAPs are not just shiny objects in the sky that can be sanitized and observed from a distance without fundamentally upsetting one's worldview.

No UFOs and whoever or whatever occupies them throws our current understanding of reality into a tailspin, which is why, beyond the secret keepers, it's why we all have a nagging unsettledness surrounding this subject, to where we almost want to rest in the stigma surrounding this subject and embrace the stigma so that we can write it off and not deal with it.

In fact, those who have studied this and those who have come forward from the government and from academia have a term for this reaction. That reaction is called ontological shock.

So what's ontological shock? Well, ontological shock is when the phenomenon so upsets one's presuppositions about what one has assumed is and isn't real and what one has assumed is and isn't possible that what ends up happening is it places one in a state of shock, very similar to how people react to finding out that they have cancer or that their spouse has been cheating on them or that their child has just died in a tragic accident.

People, when they face that news, they say, no, this can't be real. There must be some mistake. This can't be right.

Another way to describe ontological shock is to simply describe it as a worldview crisis.

The UFO phenomenon causes people to go looking for answers so that their minds that have been unsettled by the phenomenon can finally make sense of the world once again, as we considered in episode five.

It appears that some within the intelligence community have even weaponized this ontological shock and intellectual curiosity by purposefully leaving people hanging, by purposefully confusing people surrounding this subject so that they are less desperate for answers and so that they become prone to manipulation and to propaganda.

And this is precisely why we must bring the Christian worldview, which is rooted in the revelation of Scripture, to bear upon this subject as our society goes through this process of so-called UFO disclosure.

God's revelation needs to be laid out plainly so that we can finally make sense of the world once again.

Now, before we do that, we have to recognize that some Christians will respond to this information by simply clinging to the stigma.

Often, there's the fear that if we give any legitimacy to the UFO phenomenon, even if it's from a Christian worldview perspective, that we will end up legitimizing the popular worldview that's often associated with the phenomenon.

However, we have to recognize that just like with anything else, we can separate the facts and the phenomenon from the worldview through which the facts and the phenomenon are being interpreted.

For example, much of the study of biology is currently filtered through naturalistic evolutionary presuppositions, such that many Christians feel intimidated by the field of biology, and even ignore some of the most fascinating findings of the biological sciences because they assume that all of it is either evolutionary propaganda, or even worse, some may fear that the study of biology will necessarily lead one to embrace evolution.

However, we have to recognize that as apologists like Cornelius Van Tilich pointed out, there are no uninterpreted facts. All facts are interpreted.

In other words, there is no such thing as a bare fact. They are all passed through a worldview interpretation.

So, if this phenomenon is real, which it clearly is at some level, then it can certainly fit within the comprehensiveness of the Christian worldview, though being faced with it may indeed be shocking.

And that's because most of us, even Christians, have bought in to modernism and the belief of naturalism and anti-supernaturalism, even though we might deny that we have done so.

And likewise, to assume that studying something real, whether it be UAPs or biology, to assume that it will inherently lead one away from a Christian theistic perspective, that shows a very low faith in divine sovereignty and in divine revelation, and in the reality of God's existence.

And so as we conclude this episode, and as we conclude this podcast series, we're going to end by examining this subject in faith, with confidence, in the sure foundation of God's revelation.

So in order to do this, let's examine the Christian worldview, especially as it might relate to this phenomenon and the things involved with it, and then let's examine frameworks of non-Christian approaches to the subject of UFOs, and respond to those frameworks, and see how what they're observing might actually fit within, again, a Christian worldview perspective.

Now when it comes to the Christian worldview in relation to the phenomenon, let's first start by defining the Christian worldview on a few key points. On God, on creation, on humankind, and on the subject of non-human intelligence.

Now when it comes to the Christian view of God, I can't think of a simpler and better definition than the one given by Louis Berghoff in his systematic theology. He says, quote, The question may be raised whether this is a reasonable assumption, and this question may be answered in the affirmative.

And as Greg Bahnsen famously argued in his debate with the atheist Gordon Stein, the proof that God exists is that without him, you can't prove anything.

In other words, not only is the belief in God reasonable, but God himself is the one who makes reality reasonable.

You see, in Christian theology, which is derived from the divine revelation of the scriptures, God isn't simply some immense being out there who happens to be another thing in existence right next to us.

No, in the Christian worldview, God alone has existence in himself. God alone exists, and all other existence, including the universe and any other realms or dimensions that might be out there, they all exist in dependence upon his power. He grants them their existence.

This is what Christians are saying and implying when they say that God is infinite, eternal, and unchanging.

Christians and Christian theologians are saying that God exists beyond the time-space continuum, so to speak, and that he is beyond all spatial dimensions of existence.

If you are familiar with the Nicene Creed, Christians confess that God created all things, both visible and invisible.

This is important to recognize because this means that we don't believe that God is an object that can be comprehended and analyzed like anything else in the world.

And so, when it comes to this subject, this means that God, by definition, cannot be an advanced space alien, as many in the UFO subculture surmise.

Even if we were to discover some super-advanced being somewhere out there in the universe, one couldn't say, Aha! So this is what the Christian God is, a space alien.

You couldn't say that because such a being wouldn't even fit the Christian definition of what God is. The two definitions simply don't match. So it's comparing apples to oranges.

So God, then, is the presuppositional ground of all existence. He's not simply a being who happens to be in existence. He is the ground of all existence. He is the axiomatic precondition for all knowledge and for all intelligibility.

However, he is also recognized as being personal. Tri-personal, to be exact. The one true God exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, equal in power and in glory, who mutually indwell one another in perfect union and communion.

The doctrine of the Trinity. It's a mystery that's beyond our comprehension. But the Trinity shows us that not only is God the ground of all existence, but it shows us that He is also the ground of all personality and relationships.

This also shows us that God is self-contained. Because, you see, God doesn't need to create in order to fulfill something that was lacking within Himself.

No, God possesses all power and glory within Himself. Instead, through creation, out of His overflowing goodness, God creates contingent creatures who are invited in to enjoy His power and to enjoy His glory and to enjoy His fellowship.

And so when it comes to creation, the doctrine of creation, according to the Christian worldview, while we believe that God is infinite, eternal, and unchanging, creation is distinct from Him.

Creation is understood to be finite, temporal, or existing in a sequence of moments, and subject to change. It had a beginning from nothing, and it depends for its existence upon the power of God.

And God created all things from the quantum realm to the galaxies and nebulas. He created it all from nothing again, simply to manifest His glory. He did it for His own glory.

This is important to recognize because Christians don't believe that God created everything solely for man. The world does not revolve around man. We don't believe in an anthropocentric universe.

And so, for example, if we do discover concrete evidence of alien biological life, whether it be intelligent or unintelligent, the Christian who may wrestle with what that means, just as all human beings would, they can recognize that God in His freedom can choose to create whatever He wants, again, because it's all for His own glory.

In other words, creatures and aspects of creation don't need to relate directly to man in order to have purpose in God's universe, because God has His own purposes in His actions of creation and providence.

And so just as the bizarre creatures that live at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, which don't provide food or anything for man, just as they can be understood to be part of God's wondrous creation that glorifies Him, so hypothetically could alien life be viewed in the same way if it does turn out to indeed exist.

And so what about man then? What are God's purposes for man? How is man unique? Is he unique? Well, as the Westminster Shorter Catechism famously says, man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.

This is the purpose of humankind. We are also informed in the Bible and in the creeds and in the catechisms of the church that man is made to have dominion over the earth, and that he is to image God in doing so in knowledge, righteousness, and in holiness.

In other words, man was created to reflect God on the earth and out into creation, sort of like a mirror. Man is to reflect God's moral attributes, and man was designed in such a way that he would find joy and fulfillment in doing this.

And you see, what sin is, is it's a turning away from that purpose, and a turning in on oneself so that one now lives instead for their own glory and for their own enjoyment apart from God.

But this is who and what man is in the cosmic scheme of things. He is the unique image of God.

And so that brings us to the question of whether or not the Bible gives room for other intelligent creatures to exist apart from man. And believe it or not, the Bible clearly makes such room in the existence of angels and demons.

Now when it comes to defining what angels are, we have to recognize that the Bible actually gives little information as to exactly what angels are, or their ontology. Remember that term from ontological shock.

Scripture informs us that angels were created by God, that they were created apparently individually and not through family reproduction, as is the case with biological life.

Furthermore, they are said to inhabit a spiritual dimension that exists in parallel to this world, and which overlaps with this world, as we considered in prior episodes.

And in the Bible, angels and their various ranks and orders are referred to as ministering spirits, as Hebrews 1:14 says.

In other words, angels are not physical like we are, but they do have a definable existence. And like us, they have an intellect and a will which is designed to reflect God's glory in its own unique way.

And in Scripture, we see that angels can give and interpret visions. In other words, they are associated with altered states of consciousness.

And they are also capable of interacting with this world in physical ways, like the angel that killed 185,000 Syrian soldiers in 2 Kings 19:35.

Of course, we see angels often appearing physically to human beings, as the three angels did who met with Abraham in Genesis 18.

They even sometimes appear in strange flying chariots, or in the bizarre structure depicted in Ezekiel 1.

So also, we learn in Scripture that angels, while they can't perform miracles, they can perform wonders. That is, they can manipulate reality through their wisdom and power, similar to what we do through technology.

And they do that in order to achieve their own purposes, for good or for ill.

Remember, demons are not little guys in red pajamas with pitchforks. They're simply fallen angels who have that same ontology, but who use their knowledge and power to thwart God's purposes.

And how angels perform wonders, especially how they appear physically, this has been a debate amongst theologians throughout history.

For example, some theologians, like the Eastern Fathers, and Reformed theologians in the Reformation era, like Jerome Zanchias, they taught that angels were composed of a subtle form of matter, likened to fire, which can shape-shift into various forms and interact with the physical universe.

In fact, they would argue that angels must have some sort of form, or some sort of quasi-physical nature, because only the transcendent God can have a pure spiritual existence. Everything else must be bounded some way, in some definable form or body.

However, others, like the majority of the Church Fathers and men like John Calvin, they taught that angels were purely non-physical creatures of a pure mental substance, though, as John Calvin cautioned, we shouldn't speculate as to what that does and doesn't mean. It's just beyond our comprehension.

However, when it comes to the physical appearance of angels, these theologians would say that the angels appear physically and interact with the world physically, through what we could describe as a sophisticated form of puppeteering.

For example, Thomas Aquinas and Francis Turretin argue that angels, such as the angels who met and ate with Abraham in Genesis 18, they composed bodies out of compressed matter, perhaps by compressing air, and that they manipulated and worked through those bodies, and when they were done doing what they were doing, they then discarded those bodies and set them aside, or dispersed the matter that they used to compose them.

And both of these perspectives are significant, because much of what has come out about the physical nature of UFOs seems to mirror some of these discussions.

For example, Kenneth Arnold, the pilot who witnessed and coined the term, flying saucer, said later in life that the UFOs which he saw, seemed to be more like living, pulsating energy, rather than some nuts and bolts form of technology.

In fact, the most common UFO reports are of orbs, or of balls of light and energy, rather than nuts and bolts saucers with portals and nuts and rivets on them.

So thinking of the view that angels and demons are composed of subtle matter, that seems to fit right in with that view.

So also, those who have examined materials from UFOs have said that, well, they were atomically layered in a way that is very difficult for us to replicate with even all of our contemporary technology, yet the elements that they are composed of are elements that can be found here.

Dr. Gary Nolan, who has done some of this analysis, has alluded to the physical nature of UFOs as being like a possible form of 4D printing, where the phenomenon can mirror back the images and archetypes of your own mind by producing a physical apparition in front of you, using, again, material from the environment.

In fact, on a recent podcast, he compared the physical nature of UFOs to the app ports that appear in seances.

You know, one of the things I often worry about with the so-called materials that we see is you can go all the way back to John Ford and just call these things up ports. You know, some of the things that appear to be left behind are no different than the things which would show up in the middle of a medium's trance, in the middle of a table and drop from the ceiling, allegedly.

And so distinguishing something which is left behind from the other kinds of, let's say, more for tan, as I would say, for tan things is very difficult, I mean, unless you have a function.

Even Tom DeLonge, in one of his early interviews, he said that one of his advisors told him that UFOs materialize through a form of nanotech injection molding.

Even the whistleblower Dave Grush has said that though we have physical craft and bodies, he said that they could likely be interdimensional rather than the products of the engineering of biological extraterrestrials.

All of that's to say that just because the UFO phenomenon has a physical nature to it, it doesn't preclude it from being a spiritual phenomenon, as so many have observed, like Jacques Vallee, Ray Boucher, Tom DeLonge, and members of the OSOW study concluded.

After all, the physical manifestations of angels is something that even the Church Fathers wrestled with. And the behavior of the modern UFO phenomenon seems to mirror some of these discussions that were had throughout Church history.

So that's the Christian worldview and how it might intersect with modern beliefs in UFOs and revelations that are supposedly going to be coming surrounding it.

But what about the various frameworks of interpretation from the UFO community itself? What do ufologists commonly observe about UFOs and what theories do they come up with to explain them?

Well, there are three main theories that are often invoked to explain the phenomenon.

The first, of course, is the extraterrestrial hypothesis. This is the belief that UFOs are piloted in one way or another by biological aliens who have traveled here from another star system.

Now for almost everyone who studies the phenomenon, this is a theory that often falls out of favor. As Jacques Vallee has famously stated, he will be disappointed if UFOs turn out to just be aliens, as the nature of the phenomenon doesn't seem to map well to spacefaring alien explorers or to spacefaring alien invaders.

However, as I have alluded to, if hard evidence were provided for physical aliens, this wouldn't necessarily contradict the Christian worldview. As we just saw, there's already a precedent for there being other intelligent creatures, namely angels.

And so it wouldn't be too awkward for there to be other beings out there that God might have a purpose for that were just never revealed to us.

And yet hard proof for extraterrestrial biological life would have to include tangible evidence. It would have to include, I'm sorry, a map to their home planet so that we could verify that there was a planet there and that it's inhabitable. And possibly even a trip there to verify that that is indeed where they are from, if they could offer such a thing.

Because you see, as many ardent ufologists have admitted, even if aliens present themselves to us in broad daylight, if they land on the White House lawn publicly and then claim that they are from outer space, given the deceptive nature of the phenomenon so far, we shouldn't take their word for it.

In fact, throughout the past century, the pilots of UFOs that have contacted human beings allegedly have told humans that they are from all over the place, including Mars and Venus, two planets which we now know are uninhabitable.

And once we discovered that fact about a century ago, lo and behold, the story changed. And so now they say that they are from Zeta Reticuli or somewhere else, often even giving detailed star maps to contactees that are later verified by astronomers.

And so while we can accommodate aliens in theory, we would need verifiable proof for such a claim, as physical biological aliens should be able to prove with evidence and with the scientific method who they are and where they came from.

However, next to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, there is also the interdimensional hypothesis and the ultra-terrestrial hypothesis.

Now the interdimensional hypothesis proposes that these are advanced creatures, perhaps even forms of pure consciousness, that phase into our reality from another dimension and even manipulate our reality as they do so.

This is the theory of Jacques Vallee, for example, and even the theory of the recent whistleblower who will apparently be testifying to Congress.

And as many Christian apologists have pointed out, this actually maps quite well to the Biblical data concerning angels and demons.

In many ways, it seems to just be secular language for what could be understood as a spiritual world or a spiritual dimension.

So that's the interdimensional hypothesis.

Now, when it comes to the ultra-terrestrial hypothesis, this is similar, but it emphasizes that the entities behind the phenomenon are from here, perhaps from a dimension here on Earth hidden from view, or perhaps they are here in a very physical way, but they live inside mountains or under the water, as ancient myths seem to indicate about the gods.

And those who hold to the ultra-terrestrial hypothesis believe that these could be spiritual or interdimensional creatures dwelling here, or again that they could perhaps be extraterrestrials who took up residence here long before we arrived, or they believe that these ultra-terrestrials could be a breakaway civilization with advanced technology from either recent or ancient times.

Often people think maybe the Nazis discovered advanced anti-gravity technology and free energy, or maybe Atlantis did.

Either way, ultra-terrestrials are seen as cloaking their existence, deceiving us about the nature of their existence, while also influencing humanity throughout history.

Some surmise that this is why they especially became active once we started lighting off nukes, because we were threatening their home just as much as we were threatening our home.

Now, it could very well be true that there are human beings who have advanced tech in a breakaway civilization, especially in the past few decades. Many conspiracy theorists offer up evidence of such things, and often some of it does seem to be compelling.

However, if you examine the general tenor of the ultra-terrestrial hypothesis, it also maps quite well to the Christian concept of angels and demons.

Angels and demons exist here with us, though cloaked from our immediate experience, and God has used them as instruments of his providence in guiding humanity throughout history.

And we can assume that demons or fallen angels do this for the purpose of deceiving and thwarting God's purposes.

Think back to Gary Nolan's observation about the changing nature of the phenomenon throughout history.

To your point of how would you, as a higher intelligence, represent yourself to a lesser intelligence? Well, let's go back to pre-civilization. Maybe you show yourself as the spirits in the forest, and you give messages through that.

Once you get a little bit more civilized, then you show yourself as the gods. And then you're God. Well, we don't believe in God anymore, necessarily. Not everybody does. So what do we believe in? We believe in technology. So you show yourself as a form of technology.

In other words, the phenomenon says, look at these forest spirits here. Look at these gods over there. Look at this advanced tech over here.

And from a biblical perspective, this mirrors the activity of Satan in deceiving men by inspiring false religion, and by inspiring man-centered, creature-centered philosophies.

Think about it. Genesis 3 says that the serpent was the most crafty and subtle creature that God had made, and so Satan appeared to Adam and Eve as a serpent to impress Eve's consciousness and to insert a new way of thinking about God in her mind. Namely, that God is the deceiver and the one who is not to be trusted, and that she could figure it all out by sitting in judgment over him.

So there Satan functioned like an ultra-terrestrial and like one of Valet's extra-dimensional beings that seeks to influence human beliefs.

And so in our day, as Dr. Nolan observes, what do we believe in? What impresses us? We believe in technology. And so perhaps the prince of the power of the air appears to us as advanced technology and as the creatures who possess such things, so that he might then blind and distract men from the truth of God and from the gospel and lead them astray.

And so the inter-dimensional and ultra-terrestrial hypotheses fit almost like a hand in glove with the angelic, specifically with the demonic theory of what UFOs are, though again, they are couched in non-Christian terminology and formulated according to a non-Christian view of reality.

And sometimes even aspects of this perspective inadvertently come through with non-Christians who examine the UFO subject.

For example, Tom DeLonge in his interview with Fade to Black after mentioning the connection between UFOs and consciousness, as we examined in our previous episode.

Tom observed that alien abduction experiences end when one invokes the name of Jesus. And he says that his government advisors knew this about the phenomena.

Let me give you an example. You're in the middle of your house at some point and you wake up and you have little grey aliens in your room and you're being abducted. Do you know that if you call out the name of Jesus, that abduction could stop? Or if you call out the name of the source of galactic love, it'll stop. Or if you call out the name of Buddha and the love that Buddhism has, it'll stop. It doesn't matter what you call out, it's the fact that you are projecting positive energy. And that is something that needs to be understood and studied, but it doesn't mean the stuff's not physical. It is.

Now other things could be going on with UFOs aside from direct angelic or demonic activity. There is a lot about the world that we simply don't understand, and some of what is experienced with this phenomenon could be the residual effects of how the parallel world or the spiritual world interacts with this physical world.

And so some phenomenon might not necessarily be the direct activity of an angel or a demon, but just the physics of how those two realms sometimes cross over.

But this is why we need to continue to have Christians at the forefront of science and philosophy, to be thinking through radical new developments in human thought.

This is something Herman Bovink lamented, that not enough Christians in his day were interacting with things like psychology or with the theory of general relativity.

Instead, Christians tend to cling to old paradigms.

But as we have seen, what the phenomenon seems to be promoting is a new fusion of science and the spirit. And yet Christianity has long had such a holistic world view that can include science and spirit, God and creation.

In many ways, the phenomenon seems to be capitalizing on the vacuum that exists in our secular world order.

Indeed, God's revelation is comprehensive enough to make sense of this phenomenon. It's comprehensive enough to provide a general framework through which it can be approached from a Christian worldview perspective.

You see, we can face the same ontological shock as unbelievers do when seeing the reality of this phenomenon, even if the phenomenon does indeed turn out to be spiritual in nature, and it fits right in with the Bible, we can still be shocked by that, because what we've done as modern day Christians is we've relegated angels and demons to mere articles of faith, or things that we believe are out there, but which never really interact with reality as we know it.

But this whole phenomenon changes that, and it brings us back to more of a medieval worldview, the worldview that Karl Truman describes in his book, The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self, where ancient man saw himself as existing in a reality of hierarchies, including all sorts of angels and spiritual creatures that were above man and between God and man.

Though of course they believed there was only one mediator, Jesus Christ.

And it's not necessarily a bad thing to be reminded of how real that really is.

However, we also have to recognize that, at least with some of this, spiritual warfare is at play. This means that this subject should only be dealt with with extreme care, and with much prayer.

And regardless of what alien revelations might come out, whether it be an interdimensional hypothesis or the extraterrestrial hypothesis, we have to recognize that the Son of God, taking on flesh so that He was and is true and eternal God and true and historical man and one person for all eternity, that is indeed the most significant, quote, contact event that human beings could ever experience.

God has become flesh. He dwelt among us. He died as a substitute for the sins of human beings who rebelled against Him and turned away from His life and put Him to death on the cross.

And that same One who was put to death offers the forgiveness of sins and eternal life through His death, burial, and resurrection and through His Spirit, simply if we have faith in Him.

Jesus gives us the life and the communion with God that we were made for and are so desperate for. And He has triumphed over the principalities and powers, or over the fallen angelic powers, as Paul says in Colossians 2:15.

This is the revelation that trumps all other revelations, or all other disclosures that might be coming.

And so if you are in Christ, you are safe, spiritually and intellectually, and you possess the most important, quote, disclosure that has been made, the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

And if you are listening to this podcast and you don't know Christ, I urge you to open up a Bible and read the Gospel of John and pray for the Lord to open your eyes and to give you discernment.

The guilt and the shame that you carry in this life, we all have it, it can be taken away from you by Christ who said that His yoke is easy and His burden is light.

And the emptiness and the alienation that you feel in life, it can be resolved in Him, in Jesus Christ.

Because as I mentioned earlier, we were meant to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. And we do that through a relationship with Jesus Christ.

Jesus can give you life and life more abundantly. It doesn't come through the occult or through contact with the other side.

So whatever may end up being true about the phenomenon, according to the Word of God, this is what's ultimately true. You are a sinner in need of a Savior, and that Savior has been provided in Jesus Christ, the God-man.

This is the ultimate disclosure that we must all wrestle with.

I love you.
