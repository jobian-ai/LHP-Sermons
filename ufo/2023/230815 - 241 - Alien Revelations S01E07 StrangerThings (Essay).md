# The Hidden Connection: UFOs, Government Research, and the Supernatural

Most people think of UFOs and psychic research as completely separate domains - one involving mysterious objects in the sky, the other dealing with claims of mental powers. But there's a surprising connection between the two that goes back decades.

In the 1970s, the U.S. government began investigating psychic phenomena in response to reports that the Soviets were developing a psychic spy program. This research, conducted under names like Project Grill Flame and Project Stargate, explored everything from remote viewing to psychokinesis. While officially ended in the 1990s due to "inconsistent results," many claim these programs were more successful than the government admits.

What's particularly interesting is how this research overlapped with UFO investigations. The same people and institutions often worked on both. Take Jacques Vall√©e, famous for his UFO research. In the 1970s, he worked at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) helping develop protocols for testing psychic abilities. The CIA partially funded this work.

This wasn't just a coincidence. From the beginning, government researchers noticed connections between UFO encounters and consciousness-related phenomena. As early as the 1950s, Canadian official Wilbert Smith noted that the U.S. government was studying UFOs in conjunction with "mental phenomena."

The story gets stranger. In the 1990s, two Department of Defense researchers contacted a Lutheran minister named Ray Boucher. They told him they were part of a classified program trying to contact what they called "non-human intelligences" - entities they believed were behind both UFOs and various paranormal phenomena. Their goal was to understand and weaponize whatever gave these entities their apparent supernatural capabilities.

But something troubled them. Every time they seemed close to a breakthrough, things would go wrong. The phenomena they were studying appeared actively hostile. They began to wonder if they were dealing with something fundamentally malevolent.

This pattern shows up repeatedly in government research at the intersection of UFOs and consciousness. Captain David Morehouse, involved in remote viewing programs, eventually quit because he believed the protocols were making him mentally unstable and potentially opening him to demonic influence.

The government's interest in these areas continues today, though it's harder to track. Black budget programs have grown exponentially since the 1960s. The recent revelation of studies into "Havana Syndrome" - mysterious attacks that some believe involve directed energy weapons - suggests research into unconventional phenomena remains active.

What makes this history significant isn't just that it happened, but what it reveals about the nature of UFOs. The government's own research suggests these phenomena may be less about nuts and bolts spacecraft and more about consciousness and reality itself. The deeper investigators have gone, the more they've found themselves dealing with questions traditionally reserved for religion and philosophy rather than physical science.

This doesn't mean we should jump to conclusions about what UFOs are. But it does suggest we need a broader framework for understanding them than just extraterrestrial visitors in physical craft. The government's own secret research points to something far stranger - a phenomenon that seems to operate at the intersection of consciousness, physics, and what we might call the supernatural.

The truth, as usual, is stranger than fiction. Or maybe stranger than everything except fiction - shows like Stranger Things and movies like The Men Who Stare at Goats turn out to be closer to reality than most people realize. They're dramatized versions of actual government programs that explored the darkest corners of human consciousness in search of breakthrough capabilities.

The question isn't whether these programs existed - we know they did. The question is what they discovered, and why some of the people involved became convinced they were dealing with something dangerous. Those answers remain classified, but the pattern is clear enough: whenever humans have tried to master these phenomena, the phenomena seem to end up mastering them instead.
