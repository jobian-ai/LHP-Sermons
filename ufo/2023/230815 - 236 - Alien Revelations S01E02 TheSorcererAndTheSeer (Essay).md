# The Secret History of UFOs

The modern UFO story begins in an unexpected place: the court of Queen Elizabeth I. One of her advisors, John Dee, connects a surprising number of dots between Renaissance occultism and today's UFO disclosure movement.

Dee wasn't just any court advisor. He was a mathematician, astronomer, and occultist who essentially invented the concept of British naval empire - an idea he claimed came from angels, specifically the Archangel Michael. If you're wondering why that matters, consider that the recent wave of UFO sightings largely involves naval encounters.

The timing of Dee's work is significant. He operated in that fuzzy period between the Renaissance and Enlightenment when the brightest minds still thought talking to spirits was compatible with scientific advancement. In 1582, Dee began what he called "spiritual conferences" with entities claiming to be angels. These weren't casual chats - they involved elaborate rituals of crystal gazing, or "scrying."

These angels had an interesting message. They said humanity had messed things up so badly that God was putting them in charge of guiding mankind's future. They revealed what they claimed was humanity's original language (called "Enochian") and outlined a new global religion combining Protestantism with esoteric philosophy.

You might think this is just historical trivia, but Dee's influence runs deep. The Rosicrucian order, likely inspired by Dee, tried to merge occultism with scientific discovery. They called themselves the "invisible college" because they worked in secret. Here's where it gets interesting: the modern scientists and government employees pushing for UFO disclosure are also called the "invisible college" - a term coined by Jacques Vallee, one of ufology's most respected voices.

The connections don't stop there. Jack Parsons, who founded NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, practiced Dee's magical system and claimed to commune with beings who guided his rocket research. L. Ron Hubbard, before founding Scientology, joined Parsons in these practices. Even Tom DeLonge, a central figure in recent UFO disclosure efforts, references Dee in his work and acknowledges that Dee's methods were "used for communication with extraterrestrial beings."

By the 18th century, this blend of spirituality and cosmic speculation evolved further with Emanuel Swedenborg, who claimed to have visited other planets and spoken with their inhabitants. His ideas influenced everyone from Ralph Waldo Emerson to Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism.

What's fascinating is how these historical threads keep surfacing in modern UFO research. Hal Puthoff, who works with DeLonge's To The Stars Academy and holds high-level government clearances, was once a Scientologist. Jacques Vallee was a Rosicrucian before becoming a Catholic.

The pattern is clear: whenever humans face paradigm shifts in understanding our universe, some look to alleged higher beings for guidance. We saw it in the Renaissance with Dee, and we're seeing it now with UFOs. The main difference is that today's "angels" arrive in spacecraft instead of crystal visions.

This doesn't mean modern UFO phenomena are fake or that the government is hiding nothing. But it suggests our current UFO moment has deeper historical roots than most realize. We're not just dealing with unexplained lights in the sky - we're dealing with centuries-old questions about humanity's place in the universe and our relationship with whatever might be out there.
