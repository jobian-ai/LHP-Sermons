# INTRO

I don't think it's bird, I don't think it's bug. I think it's exactly what a UFO stands for, unidentified flying object.

We did discover and explore many, many things in ways that frankly at the beginning look almost like a miracle. And then as we go forward, it looks like something new we never would have guessed.

Hey, hey! Unexplained sightings of flying objects in the sky for decades.

The space agency launching a new team to investigate who or what may be behind the unexplained sightings.

Just last month, this video shot on an iPhone during an air show in Miami appears to show something shooting up out of the water with people swimming nearby.

Of unidentified aerial phenomena, UAP, or what we all call unidentified flying objects.

When I saw it, I was like, what in the, like no way!

The UAP is a UAP-related object. It is a UAP-related object. It is a UAP-related object.

We are listening to an alien revelation, the history of UFO disclosure. This is episode nine, punk rock and UFO fight club.

Look at this! Oh my gosh! Wow!

# PODCAST

Members of the press, the American public, and people of the world. We are here today to disclose the truth about a subject that has been ridiculed and questioned, denied, for at least 50 years. The men and women who are on this stage and the some 350 additional military intelligence witnesses to the so-called UFO matter and extraterrestrial intelligence can prove and will prove that we are not alone.

At the end of our previous episode, we saw how the acclimatization process of the 1980s and 1990s really came to a headway with the man whose voice you just heard, Dr. Steven Greer.

Greer's press conference, which occurred in May of 2001, would garner some media attention. However, it would be quickly forgotten as a few months later, the tragic events of September 11th would change the course of history for the decades ahead.

However, there would be two individuals who would be paying closer attention to Dr. Greer. Reporter Leslie Keene and Blink-182 lead singer Tom DeLonge.

And both of these individuals would be instrumental not only in the mainstreaming of UFOs and in the mainstreaming of the push for UFO disclosure, but they would also be instrumental in the production of the groundbreaking New York Times article in 2017, which largely pushed UFOs into the mainstream.

Now, Leslie Keene, the author of said article, was actually in attendance at Steven Greer's 2001 Press Club event.

As reported in the New Yorker's piece entitled How the Pentagon Started Taking UFOs Seriously, Keene was intrigued, yet somewhat appalled, by Greer's press conference because while he certainly brought out compelling testimony, there were many other outlandish claims made by him and by his witnesses without any supporting evidence, such as claims about alien cadavers and top-secret crash retrieval teams.

Having just published a well-researched article on the reality of UFOs in the Boston Globe, Keene wondered whether or not there might be a better way to present compelling testimony and compelling evidence for UFOs, while also avoiding the more outlandish claims that turn most people off from the subject.

Between 2001 and 2017, Keene would research and then publish a book in 2011 entitled UFOs, Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go On the Record.

The book would document evidence and testimony from militaries and from governments around the world, which seemed to demonstrate that there was indeed a reality to the UFO phenomenon and that it had remained unexplained.

And as she purposed after the press conference back in 2001, she did this while, again, avoiding the more outlandish and sensational claims that turn many people off, even if there is merit to such claims about alien bodies and crash retrieval programs.

The book would garner the interest of the former White House Chief of Staff for Bill Clinton, John Podesta, who would write the foreword to the book.

And remember, John Podesta was one of the key figures mentioned in the WikiLeaks emails that revealed that Tom DeLonge was indeed talking to generals and other high-level officials about UFOs just before the 2016 election.

In fact, Podesta was listed as the host of those meetings.

And you see, to most people who are familiar with Mr. Podesta, that is actually no surprise because he has been a longtime advocate for UFO disclosure, being a central figure in the Clinton initiatives back in the 1990s, which we considered in our previous episode.

However, while Keane was pursuing an interest in UFOs from a credible journalistic perspective, culminating in her book in 2011, Tom DeLonge was also beginning to think about stepping away from Blink-182 in order to pursue the subject and to promote it from a cultural level, particularly to the youth.

Now, to just give you some background, Tom DeLonge has always been very open about his lifelong interest and even obsession with the UFO subject.

This was reflected even in some of his music, like the track entitled Aliens Exist on the album Enema of the State.

Hey mom, there's something in the back roomHope it's not the creatures from above

However, as Tom continued to grow in fame and in fortune, so did his interest in the phenomenon.

He began assembling a library of books and videos on the topic and began to come to the realization that the phenomenon was much more complex than the typical space invaders from popular science fiction.

Due to his interest, he would get in touch with researchers in the early 2010s and would even have his own close encounter experience of high strangeness after engaging in meditation practices out in the desert.

In fact, many researchers assume that Tom was in touch with Dr. Stephen Greer at that time and probably even joined him in the desert to practice his CE-5 protocols, which is what led to his alleged encounter.

And for the record, Dr. Greer does claim to have been in touch with Tom DeLonge during that time period, and so this is a reasonable assumption to make.

However, like Kean, Tom would want to go in his own direction apart from Greer for various reasons, and he would want to do so in a way that could influence mass culture while also working with the secret keepers.

You see, Tom had the idea that using books, movies, and music to bring the reality of UFOs to the general public could be an effective strategy to reduce the stigma while also sidestepping erroneous and sensational claims surrounding UFO subculture while also getting the government and the media to seriously engage with the subject.

However, in order to embark on this project, Tom knew that he needed advisors from the inside. He knew he needed advisors from inside the government who were involved with this subject to not only give him their blessing, but to also advise him as to the accuracy of the information that he was relaying to the public.

Having built an extensive UFO library, Tom was surely aware of groups like the Aviary and the Invisible College, and even the famous Majestic 12 group, and how they had all engaged with researchers in decades past, and so Tom apparently used those historical breadcrumbs from his research to carve his own path in making contact with them so that he could present his ideas to them.

In other words, Tom wanted to act as a PR spokesperson or a middleman between the so-called secret keepers in the government and the general public.

And this would be good timing because while Tom was becoming more engaged with this subject in the 2010s, elements within the US government were becoming increasingly convinced that this is a subject that should be pursued more openly.

As I mentioned way back in our first episode, Senators including the late Harry Reid put forward the legislation to form and fund ATIP, or the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which would end up being a DoD and DIA project in conjunction with private contractors like Robert Bigelow of Bigelow Aerospace.

ATIP and Bigelow would again follow a largely scientific approach to the phenomenon in line with what Colonel John Alexander outlines in his book UFOs, Myths, Conspiracies, and Realities.

And remember, Colonel Alexander was allegedly given the name the Penguin in the Aviary Group, or the Chickadee, according to some.

ATIP would avoid pursuing Majestic 12-type conspiracy theories or assumptions about deeply hidden black-budget programs, and ATIP would instead focus on the facts of various military encounters while subjecting testimony from pilots and sensory data to scientific rigor, which is largely what Colonel Alexander recommended in his book mentioned just a moment ago.

However, ATIP and its manager, Mr. Luis Elizondo, whom we mentioned in the first episode, he would try to discover if there indeed were any other stovepipes in the government that possessed data and information relevant to the subject.

And as Elizondo has alluded to on a few occasions, he did indeed find evidence that such deeply hidden programs do in fact exist.

Of course, ATIP's more mundane findings would be made public as Mr. Elizondo resigned in October of 2017 and joined Tom DeLonge's To the Stars Academy in order to, as some people argue, work for the intelligence community in the public sphere.

However, rumors about secret government programs would initially remain off the table as that news broke.

**But as the years have progressed, Elizondo and others have become more and more open about the fact that they found evidence that such things exist.

There was a darker side to ATIP as well. You see, despite the attempt to avoid the woo, so to speak, while investigating this subject, journalists like George Knapp and investigators like Jeremy Korbel have uncovered that ATIP was also part of a larger program called AUSAP, or the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program.

In their book Skinwalkers at the Pentagon, George Knapp, Dr. James Lakatsky, and Dr. Colm Kelleher document that AUSAP was indeed the parent program to ATIP and its focus went well beyond the subject of UFOs.

Now, again, for context, this is significant because Dr. Lakatsky and Dr. Kelleher were two of the chief scientists with AUSAP and their book that they published with George Knapp was approved by the Pentagon for release.

Furthermore, Luis Elizondo, the director of ATIP, has acknowledged that Dr. Lakatsky functioned as his boss while running the ATIP portfolio.

So it does indeed appear that ATIP was just a sub-program of AUSAP which was set up to focus only on the UFO phenomenon.

However, again, AUSAP, the larger parent program, was much broader in scope.

So what then was the focus of AUSAP? Well, AUSAP has been described by some as an attempt by members of the Pentagon to understand the paranormal so that it can be tested, understood, and perhaps even weaponized for military purposes.

And the focus of AUSAP in studying the paranormal would largely center upon a ranch in northeast Utah known as Skinwalker Ranch.

Now, if this podcast had been released just a few years ago, I would probably have to go to great lengths to explain what Skinwalker Ranch is.

However, due to the popular History Channel docuseries The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, along with other paranormal shows that have covered the ranch, I'm sure that many of you have at least heard of it.

Even pop culture icons like Post Malone have taken an interest in the ranch and have even visited it hoping to catch a glimpse of something paranormal.

But what many don't realize is that Skinwalker Ranch was the original focus of the UFO program that so many have heard about in the media recently.

Now, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, Skinwalker Ranch is a ranch in the Uinta Basin of Utah that is known for all sorts of high strangeness. Everything from UFOs to bizarre cryptid creatures to poltergeist phenomenon to portals in the sky along with strange illnesses have all been reported by those who are on or near the ranch.

In fact, the title Skinwalker Ranch refers to Navajo legends of shape-shifting witches who went by the title Skinwalkers.

Local Native American legends actually tie a Navajo curse to the ranch, which is the supposed origin of all the supernatural happenings on the ranch.

Former owners of the property were even scared off of the property because of all the high strangeness that they experienced, which is what led billionaire Robert Bigelow to purchase the ranch in 1996 and to hand it over to his team of scientific investigators who went by the name of the quote National Institute for Discovery Sciences.

And you see many of those who worked for NIDS, as it came to be known, had also worked for the government in secret access programs, and many of them had a longtime interest in UFOs.

So you see the two subjects have always intersected, as we've learned throughout this series. That is the general subject of the paranormal and the specific subject of UFOs.

Those two have always intersected, and that's even reflected in the broad program known as OSAP, which had a subsection focused on UFOs.

But how the study of Skinwalker Ranch got rolled into the congressionally funded program OSAP was interesting to say the least.

You see, Dr. Colm Kelleher, who had worked for Robert Bigelow, and journalist George Knapp had published another book back in 2005 entitled Hunt for the Skinwalker.

While the book was not well known at the time, it did grab the attention of many in the intelligence community who thought that the ranch could be studied for military and intelligence purposes in seeking to both understand the paranormal and the UFO mystery and to thus develop weapons based upon their findings.

This would eventually lead to Dr. Likatsky visiting the ranch on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency, or the DIA, where he would experience a strange apparition that floated right before him that was in the shape of what's called a Möbius Strip.

And as he saw this apparition of this Möbius Strip, it reminded him of the cover of a Mike Oldfield album entitled Tubular Bells.

Now, this particular encounter has disturbed many because the first song on Tubular Bells is a familiar tune that is associated in pop culture with all things dark and demonic.

And if you haven't seen the movie, that is actually the intro music to the movie The Exorcist.

So think about it. The government began investigating Skinwalker Ranch due in part to one of their officials seeing an apparition that was tied in his mind to the theme music for The Exorcist.

Now, a whole series could be done on AUSAP and on Skinwalker Ranch, hence the History Channel series that's now on its fourth season.

But suffice it to say, that investigators came to believe that what was happening on the ranch was real, yet elusive to scientific investigation.

They also discovered on the ranch that there was a link between the UFO phenomenon and what we call the paranormal.

For example, in the book Skinwalkers at the Pentagon, the authors, that includes Knapp and Likatsky and Colm Kelleher, point out that there is what's called a Hitchhiker Effect, which affects all of those who seem to come onto the ranch.

And it often manifests as poltergeist phenomenon that will follow them back home and trouble them, often for months and for years even.

And yet, according to the authors, this same Hitchhiker Effect has also been experienced by military pilots who have encountered UFOs while on duty.

This, coupled with Likatsky's bizarre encounter on the ranch, has led some Pentagon officials to see both UFOs and the phenomenon at Skinwalker Ranch as being tied to the demonic realm and to demonic activity.

And as Lou Elizondo and many others have said, there were efforts by evangelical Christians from within the Pentagon to shut down OSAP and ATIP out of a fear that interacting with the phenomenon could open up a doorway to the demonic in our world.

I remember conversation very well. This is a person I respected tremendously, very, very senior person. He told me, he said, Lou, I want you to stop doing this.

I said, OK, sir, I certainly can't, but may I ask why? And he says, well, we already know what it is.

Now at that moment, I honestly thought maybe it was our own technology. I was running up against some super uber secret SAP and, you know, they were telling me to stop.

And I said, OK, sir, so it's ours? And he said, no, that's not what I'm saying.

And he said, he asked me point blank, have you read your Bible lately? And I wasn't quite sure where we were going with that.

I said, well, sir, I think I know what it says. Where are you going with this? And he said, well, then you would know that these things are demonic and we should not be pursuing them.

In fact, many have tied this reaction by some in the Pentagon to the group of intelligence officials who contacted Dr. Ray Boucher back in the 1990s, as we touched on in Episode 7, the group known as the Collins Elite.

And it's alleged that to this day, there remains a group of well-connected Christians in the Pentagon who are either trying to shut down research into UFOs or who are at least trying to disclose the reality of UFOs with the caveat that it is evil and demonic.

This has caused many in the UFO community to be wary of the voice of Christians in this area of study, as it's assumed that all Christians will approach the subject with the same level of dogma-infused, willful ignorance.

However, OSAP and ATIP would not be shut down, and both programs would continue to produce mountains of data that many in the program felt should be shared with the general public and with the scientific and academic communities.

So how then do you bring such a large, complicated subject to the public? How do you break it to a materialistic, secular culture that the paranormal is real and that UFOs are real and that UFOs are much stranger than we think?

How can you bring these things to the general public in a way that they can understand and digest? Well, you hire a punk rocker, of course.

And so that brings us full circle back to Tom DeLonge.

You see, what happened in December of 2017, along with everything leading up to it, didn't come about on a whim. It came about through much thought and careful planning.

As I alluded to in our first episode, Tom claimed in the years leading up to 2017 that he had established contact with members of the government and with members of the military-industrial complex and with the intelligence agencies in order to slowly bring about UFO disclosure to mainstream culture.

Tom went on radio programs like Coast to Coast AM and Fade to Black, not only to announce the formation of his new company, To the Stars, but to also inform the UFO subculture that disclosure would indeed finally be coming partly through the efforts of his company and advisors.

And as we recounted in our first episode, after the WikiLeaks dump of Hillary Clinton's emails in 2016, it was revealed that Tom was indeed working with high-level generals, with men like General McCaslin of the famed Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and with government officials like John Podesta.

And of course, later in October of 2017, just two months prior to the famed New York Times article being released, Tom would walk out on stage and announce the formation of the To the Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences, being joined by men like former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher Mellon, former CIA officers like Jim Semivan, and former CIA physicists like Hal Puthoff, and of course, Luis Elizondo along with a few others.

But what was interesting was that in the interviews that Tom gave prior to 2017, he consistently said that his understanding that UFOs were somehow related to consciousness and to the paranormal, that this was one of the main reasons why insiders agreed to work with him.

As Tom has narrated it, he first became plugged into the inner circle of UFO secret keepers at a family event for a major aerospace corporation, most likely Lockheed Skunk Works, where Tom was asked to introduce the president of the company.

After the introduction, Tom then asked for a private meeting with the executive, who was most likely Robert Weiss per the WikiLeaks dump, which then led to several meetings where the executive initially denied, but then affirmed the reality of UFOs, and where he admitted that Tom's plan to bring about disclosure through books, movies, through social media, and through political activism could actually work.

But as Tom has narrated it, it was when he said that there was a connection between UFOs and consciousness that the executive especially began to take him seriously while affirming his conclusion.

And just think back to the memo that we considered in past episodes from the Canadian government, where they had concluded that the US government was indeed studying UFOs, that it was the most highly kept secret, surpassing even that of the H-bomb, and that it was involved with mental phenomena.

This was so significant that when Tom gave one of his initial interviews with Fade to Black back in 2016, he began by touching on the subject of how consciousness is actually central to the UFO phenomenon.

Tom, that's a very awesome word that you used with them, consciousness, right?

Yeah. And that must have, seriously for them, probably took him by surprise, but to have them concur, you knew that you were on the right path.

What happened next?

We had a discussion for 65 minutes about consciousness.

One of the more important things I'm going to share with you guys this evening is that the UFO phenomenon is tied to consciousness.

And for a lot of people, that's going to be very hard to understand because they think this is hokey pokey, spiritual, interdimensional, like, whatever.

Whatever your mind goes to, you know, when people say the word consciousness, but what you need to understand is that the universe itself, and all things in it, contain some very, very interesting properties and life forms.

In other words, one of the primary spokesmen for the current push for UFO disclosure, the man who put together the original dream team, which has made this subject go mainstream, he essentially affirmed some of what we have seen throughout this series, that the UFO phenomenon is tied to consciousness and to the paranormal.

You see, in Tom DeLonge, those in the government, and those in the intelligence community who wanted this information out, found in Tom a conduit who could help untangle this subject and all the secrecy that they had built around it, place it before the public in a way that they could slowly understand and digest.

However, it wasn't just Tom the punk rocker who would develop a synergy with insiders. An articulate and thoughtful academic would also be brought into the fold around this same time.

Throughout this series, I've mentioned professor of religious studies, Diana Pasulka, quite a few times.

In a lecture given at Rice University in March of 2022, Dr. Pasulka observed that as she was preparing to publish her book entitled American Cosmic, that everything seemed to come together with this subject finally going mainstream, something that she wasn't expecting to occur.

Just after I turned in my book manuscript, the New York Times published a series of articles documenting the existence of secret government programs of scientists who studied UFOs, just as I had discussed in my book.

By the way, I didn't know Leslie at the time.

The articles bold declarations were illustrated with seeming video evidence, which included fighter jet pilots cursing and joking about the now famous Tic Tac flying machines that were also recorded on radar by Naval intelligence officers.

My book was impressed during these electrifying media disclosures.

Just like everyone, I was amazed and shocked.

Although I had predicted like something like this would happen, I honestly didn't expect it to happen so soon.

One year after this, other media media, I'm sorry, other media sources, including The New Yorker, The Washington Post, The Atlantic and others, begin to publish similar stories about UFOs.

My book was then published in 2019.

These reporters reached out to me.

Some of them revealed that they had been given a mandate to write about the topic, and one reporter even stated that he wasn't at all keen to write about UFOs, but would follow the mandate anyway.

At the time, I thought that was strange, and I still think it's strange.

Between 2019 and 2020, there were rumors that the United States government would do something historic with respect to knowledge of UFOs.

And as we have seen, the media and the government have remained engaged with the subject ever since, and so has academia, as exemplified by Dr. Pazolka, who has sort of become a contact point for those who wish to take the subject seriously from an academic perspective.

And what's interesting about Dr. Pazolka is that as she recounts in her book, she became plugged in with a group of academics and scientists who were affiliated with the intelligence community and with the space programs, and who also happened to study UFOs, both officially for the entities that they worked for, as well as a personal hobby of theirs.

And what she found out was that there was a whole network of such individuals who formed what some have called both an invisible college, as we saw in our episode entitled The Invisible College, but also that there was a visible college.

In other words, there were those who studied the phenomenon while being involved with classified research, hence why they had to remain invisible, and there were those who also studied it from an academic perspective, and who remained partly visible, who yet needed to remain coy about their interest in the subject and their findings surrounding the subject, so as to remain respectable within their various fields of expertise.

Pazolka named this amalgamation of scientists and academics in the visible and invisible college. She gave them the title UFO Fight Club, because they really seemed to follow the creed of Tyler Durden in the 1999 cult classic Fight Club.

Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club.

The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.

The second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.

In other words, do not talk about our research into UFOs.

In fact, in her book, she points out that even as these scientists and academics are talking amongst themselves, they talk about their research in euphemisms.

They do not openly talk about how they are interested in studying UFOs.

So again, the first rule about Fight Club is do not talk about Fight Club.

The second rule is do not talk about Fight Club.

That seemed to be the motto of this group.

Two interesting characters from UFO Fight Club that are featured in her book go by the pseudonyms James and Tyler, the latter one after Tyler Durden from Fight Club.

James is an academic who is also an experiencer of the phenomenon, who has become involved with government research into UFOs, mostly through studying the biological effects of those who are experiencers of the phenomenon.

Tyler, on the other hand, is a NASA employee who also works for the intelligence community, who claims to have regular contact with the phenomenon, and who also claims to receive inspiration for science and technology through his contact with the phenomenon.

Remember, we considered him back in episode three.

And interestingly enough, at the beginning of her book, Tyler actually takes Dr. Pazolka and James to a site in the New Mexican desert, where a UFO had allegedly crashed after World War II.

And at the site, with the help of some special metal detectors, Tyler, James, and Diana not only found some strange metals, but Tyler also disclosed to them that the site that they were at was used as a scene in the new seasons of The X-Files.

And that's a fact that was confirmed by Dr. Pazolka in reviewing that episode from The X-Files.

And so that seemed to confirm the whole idea that insiders have indeed been involved with acclimatizing the public to this subject through media and through TV shows.

But what is also striking about Pazolka's book is that she not only examines belief in UFOs as constituting a new form of religion, but she also documents how members of the so-called UFO Fight Club have been involved with the mainstreaming of belief in UFOs, especially after Leslie Keen and Ralph Blumenthal's article in 2017.

In fact, Dr. Gary Noland of Stanford University, whom we have heard from throughout this series, he has identified himself as the character James in her book.

And he is also one of the foremost scientists and academics speaking to this issue in the halls of Congress and to the media.

Think back again to our first episode, where Dr. Gary Noland was talking to none other than Tucker Carlson on his program on Fox Nation.

So also, Tyler has been identified as a NASA scientist named Dr. Tim Taylor, though that was revealed by sleuthing the public records of those admitted into the Vatican Observatory as Pazolka and Taylor traveled there together in the book.

Dr. Taylor, though, has yet to publicly identify himself as Dr. Noland has.

But Diana's book is not only a fascinating study of the phenomenon and of the effects of the phenomenon from a religious studies perspective, but it is also a living, breathing example of this disclosure process moving forward and going mainstream.

Because you see, those who had to go under pseudonyms in Pazolka's book, like Dr. Noland, can now speak openly and publicly about their study of the phenomenon, even appearing on major news networks and briefing members of Congress on the UAP subject.

So also, the fact that one of the top scientists involved with the UFO Fight Club ends up converting to Roman Catholicism at the end of Dr. Pazolka's book, this demonstrates that this is a subject that, again, leads to larger worldview questions, usually involving religious questions.

So whereas Tom DeLonge's organization would mainstream UFO disclosure through pop culture and through the media, Dr. Pazolka and those she networked with would bring it academic respectability, which has also gained the attention of the media.

In fact, in an interview given before the SALT conference in May of 2023, Gary Noland stated with confidence before some of the world's most influential thought leaders of his belief that aliens are indeed here and had been here for a long time.

Do you believe that extraterrestrial intelligence has visited planet Earth?

I think you can go a step further. It hasn't just visited. It's been here a long time and it's still here.

And it has basically, you know, people talk about the wow signal, looking for extraterrestrial intelligence.

The wow signal is that people see it on an almost regular basis.

That's the communication that's already here.

And that statement seems so incredible that it's tough to believe.

People hear that and maybe a lot of people here hear that and they don't believe it.

And so I'm curious, if you had to assign a probability to that statement that you believe extraterrestrial intelligence has visited this planet, what probability would you assign?

A hundred percent.

Dr. Noland also alluded to the fact that he was aware of whistleblowers that would be coming forward in the summer of 2023 who would accelerate the conversation going forward.

He even stated that whistleblowers were coming forward in DC and shaking things up.

And indeed on June 5, 2023, the Debrief would publish an article once again by Leslie Keen and Ralph Blumenthal about a whistleblower named David Grush, a man who previously worked as a top intelligence official for the UAPTF, who discovered that not only were UFOs real and anomalous, but more significantly, he discovered that there were indeed black-budget programs focused on these phenomena.

In a series of interviews with journalist Ross Coulthart on NewsNation, Grush would make sensational claims stating that we are definitely not alone and that the government possesses quite a few crashed UFOs along with alien bodies.

If you're telling us the truth, everyone, the entire American public, has been lied to for decades.

Yeah, there's a sophisticated disinformation campaign targeting the US populace, which is extremely unethical and immoral.

You are saying to the human race, for the first time, an official intelligence representative at a high level from the US government is saying publicly, we are not alone.

We're definitely not alone.

Absolutely, the data points empirically that we're not alone, yeah.

Do we have bodies? Do we have species?

Well, naturally, when you recover something that's either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots.

And believe it or not, as fantastical as that sounds, it's true.

This claim would be corroborated by other unnamed whistleblowers who were in contact with the media, including one of the journalists who broke the Twitter files for Elon Musk, a journalist named Michael Shellenberger.

As I am recording this podcast, Congress is openly preparing for hearings that will feature pilots and whistleblowers like Mr. Grush, which will be led by congressmen like Republican Tim Burchett, a longtime advocate for UFOs disclosure.

Quickly on this next one, Congressman, the House Oversight Committee will hold a UFO hearing after a military whistleblower claims there is extraterrestrial life.

You are leading the investigation in 15 seconds. Will we get answers as to whether or not we're alone?

We're not alone and we'll get some answers. And I talked to that man yesterday and I'm hoping that he'll be hearing as well.

But we've been planning this for quite some time.

He did it in 10 seconds and now I'm utterly terrified.

But again, all of this is the amalgamation of the efforts of punk rockers, government insiders, talented academics and members of the UFO Fight Club.

And it appears at least to be leading society toward a paradigm shift of cosmic proportions.

And to many, any credible proof of alien craft and alien bodies will seem to be clear evidence that we are not alone and that our world is preparing to be transformed by alien revelations that will force us to rethink everything.

And as always, we will have to wait and see if this actually pans out.

However, in the meantime, as Christians, we need to ground ourselves so that we are prepared to face the facts, whatever they might be, while remaining firm in our presuppositions and in our commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

And that's what we will do in our final episode on the Christian worldview approach to this subject and to the various motifs of interpretation that exist concerning the phenomenon.

And we will examine that in Episode 10, Disclosure and Revelation.

# OUTRO

I'm the around. I'm the around. Definitely the around.

My God. Oh my God. Wow.

So fun.
