# The UFO Tipping Point

Something interesting happened with UFOs between 2017 and 2023. They went from being a fringe topic that respectable people avoided to something discussed seriously in mainstream media and Congress.

This shift didn't happen by accident. It was orchestrated by an unlikely alliance of three groups: government insiders who wanted to gradually reveal what they knew, academics who wanted to study the phenomenon properly, and a punk rock musician who saw an opportunity to bridge these worlds.

The musician was Tom DeLonge from Blink-182. What made DeLonge effective wasn't just his celebrity status, but that he understood something crucial: UFOs aren't just about strange objects in the sky. They're connected to consciousness and what we call the paranormal. This insight helped him gain the trust of insiders who had been studying the phenomenon for decades.

The academics were represented by people like Diana Pasulka, who documented what she called the "UFO Fight Club" - scientists and researchers who studied UFOs seriously but couldn't talk about it openly. The first rule of UFO Fight Club was, naturally, not to talk about UFO Fight Club.

The government insiders came from programs like AATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program) and its parent program AAWSAP (Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program). These weren't just studying UFOs - they were studying everything from consciousness to paranormal phenomena at places like Skinwalker Ranch.

What's remarkable is how these three groups - the punk rocker, the academics, and the insiders - managed to work together to change public perception. They didn't just dump everything at once. They released information gradually, through careful coordination of media coverage, academic research, and government disclosures.

The turning point came in December 2017 with a New York Times article that revealed the existence of AATIP. This wasn't just another UFO story - it was carefully crafted to be credible enough for mainstream audiences while hinting at deeper mysteries.

The strategy worked because it avoided the two extremes that had previously dominated UFO discourse: complete denial and wild speculation. Instead, it presented evidence in a way that reasonable people could take seriously.

This approach continues today, with congressional hearings and whistleblower testimony suggesting we may be approaching an even bigger revelation. Whether or not that happens, what's already occurred is remarkable: a subject that was once relegated to tabloids is now discussed seriously in Congress and mainstream media.

There's a broader lesson here about how paradigm shifts happen. They don't occur through sudden revelations that completely upend everyone's worldview. Instead, they happen gradually, through careful coordination between different groups who each play their part in making the unthinkable thinkable, the unsayable sayable.

The UFO disclosure process shows how this works: you need insiders who know the truth, academics who can study it rigorously, and cultural translators who can make it accessible to the public. Miss any of these elements and you're likely to fail.

What's happening with UFOs might be a template for how other paradigm shifts could occur. The key seems to be finding the right balance between revelation and restraint, between credibility and accessibility. Too much restraint and nothing changes; too little and you lose credibility.

The story isn't over yet. But whatever happens next, the way this subject has moved from the fringe to the mainstream offers valuable lessons about how to change deeply held beliefs about what is and isn't possible.
