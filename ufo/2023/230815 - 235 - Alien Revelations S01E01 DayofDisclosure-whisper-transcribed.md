So if you want to have more content like this, where we could create more series, ten part series where you can just binge through, rather than having to wait a single week, go to thecultistshow.com forward slash donate.

That being said, enjoy Alien Revelations episodes one through ten, starting now.

## INTRO

I don't think it's a bird. I don't think it's a bug. I think it's exactly what a UFO stands for. An unidentified flying object.

We did discover and explore many, many things in ways that, frankly, at the beginning, look almost like a miracle. And then, as we go forward, it looks like something new we never would have guessed.

Unexplained sightings of flying objects in the sky for decades. The space agency launching a new team to investigate who or what may be behind the unexplained sightings.

Just last month, this video shot on an iPhone during an air show in Miami appears to show something shooting up out of the water with people swimming nearby.

Of unidentified aerial phenomena, UAP, or what we all call unidentified flying objects.

When I saw it, I was like, what in the... like, no way!

Check out the monkey. Mark it. I get by. I am the man.

Listening to an alien revelation. A history of UFO disclosure. This is episode one. The Day of Disclosure.

On one hand, you have the potential to be foreign adversarial technology flying within controlled U.S. airspace. And, of course, on the other opposite end of the spectrum, you have something which is completely and entirely different than anything that we're aware of.

And that's the big question, isn't it? What are these things? And the bottom line is that we don't know.

The Pentagon recently formed a new office to study UFO reports, and now, now it's NASA's turn.

At this moment in time, we do not have enough data to really conclude. Does that mean that it's not extraterrestrial life? I'm a scientist, and if somebody asks me, is this extraterrestrial life, frankly, at this moment in time, the simple answer is the right one, which is I don't know.

The date was December 16th, 2017. I was working my tent-making job as a commercial window cleaner. For those of you who don't know, tent-making is shorthand for a pastor who works a side job. When suddenly on my smartphone, a headline popped up from Disclose.TV saying something to the effect of, Breaking News, Tom DeLonge announces UFO disclosure through the New York Times.

Having heard Tom DeLonge's claims for months that he was working with insiders to push for UFO disclosure, along with repeated claims that he made that some big announcement was coming related to this coming disclosure, I stood in the parking lot where I was working stunned.

After quickly reading through the article and examining the linked New York Times article, I immediately shared it with my brother-in-law who was working with me at the time, to which he responded with his tongue in the proverbial cheek, asking, well, are people rioting in the streets yet?

You see, what Tom DeLonge accomplished is something that people who follow the UFO subject only ever dreamed of, yet they doubted that it would ever occur, official acknowledgement from the US government that there really was something to this whole subject of UFOs, and that it's not just the delusional fantasies of conspiracy cranks and New Age nut cases.

Instead, the article revealed that this subject was being taken seriously by some of the highest levels of the US government, and had been for quite some time.

And all of this was accomplished by a punk rocker of all people, who claimed for years that he was working with military generals, NASA officials, and various intelligence agencies to eventually disclose the truth about this subject in a way that the public could take seriously and digest.

You see, while there had always been reasonable people associated with the study of UFOs, men like Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was the chief scientific advisor for the Air Force's Project Blue Book, yet the media's approach to the subject, whenever it was brought up, had largely been one of denial and ridicule.

But everything changed on that Saturday towards the end of 2017 when the New York Times published the article that was entitled, Glowing Auras and Black Money, the Pentagon's Mysterious UFO Program.

After spending two months researching and verifying the story that Tom DeLonge's organization shared with them, the authors of the article from the New York Times, Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal, told the story of what was called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, or ATIP, as it's come to be called.

The program was created in 2007 by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, and Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. The idea for the program was hatched not only in response to a reported increase in military UFO encounters at the time, but also because men like former astronaut John Glenn had come to his senator friends and urged them to set up a program to look into the subject with congressional oversight.

At the center of the New York Times article was a man named Luis Elizondo, an intelligence officer with 22 years of service in the Department of Defense. Mr. Elizondo ran ATIP from 2007 until it officially lost funding in 2012, at which point he claims the program continued under different funding mechanisms, a claim which has since been verified.

As the New York Times reported, he resigned in protest from the Department of Defense on October 4th of 2017, just over two months prior to the now famous article being published.

According to Elizondo, the program continued to produce mountains of data demonstrating that UFOs were not only a reality, but that they were actively engaging with our military. However, due to bureaucratic incompetence, in Elizondo's opinion, the information was not making it into the right hands.

As the New York Times reported, Elizondo then joined Tom DeLonge's To the Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences later that October, along with former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher Mellon and physicist and former Scientologist Hal Puthoff, who was famous for running the CIA's psychic spy program in the 1970s, a subject that we will touch on in this series.

The focus of To the Stars Academy, or TTSA as it would come to be called, was to begin a process of public relations while lobbying Congress to push for oversight of this subject and to further disclose information about the UFO phenomenon, a push that's been relatively successful in recent years and continues up until our present day.

Along with Mr. Elizondo, the article also produced two videos that were confirmed as being genuine by Department of Defense chain of custody documentation. The videos are entitled Gimbal and Fleer One along with Go Fast, which was later released by the Washington Post.

Each of the videos were allegedly related to AATIP investigations, and they were corroborated by pilot and radar operator testimony. Pilots in the videos can be heard expressing amazement as they are grappling with what they are seeing.

As experts began pointing out in the media, what was particularly noteworthy in these videos was not only the pilot reaction, but also the fact that no exhaust plume or heat signature appeared behind these objects, even though they were flying at high speeds and were taken in infrared mode.

In other words, these videos released by the government really did seem to provide tangible proof of something strange going on in our skies.

The article, along with the release of the videos, would lead to a flurry of news reports there in the final weeks of 2017. Mr. Elizondo went on to appear on almost every major news network, and he even hesitatingly stated on CNN that AATIP found evidence that we may not be alone.

Along with Elizondo, Commander David Fravor, who was the leader of the U.S. Army, said that the U.S. Army is the only place in the U.S. Army that can be used to protect itself from the threat of a nuclear bomb. The U.S. Army is the only place in the U.S. Army that can be used to protect itself from the threat of a nuclear bomb.

In a statement by Rosando, he stated on Fox News that he believed that the object, which could achieve hypersonic speeds at an estimated 100-plus Gs, was something not from this world.

So bottom line, what do you think this was?

I believe, as do the other folks that were on the flight when we visually saw it, that it was something not from this world.

In addition, the New York Times article also mentioned that Las Vegas aerospace billionaire Robert Bigelow, who was contracted through ATIP, also had metal alloys in his Vegas facilities associated with the government's UFO investigations through ATIP.

Just months prior to the article coming out, Bigelow boasted on 60 Minutes to Lara Logan that he had spent millions of dollars investigating the UFO phenomenon and that he was convinced that there's an existing ET presence here on planet Earth.

I'm absolutely convinced that's all there is to it.

Do you also believe that UFOs have come to Earth?

There has been and is an existing presence, an ET presence, and I've spent millions and millions, I've probably spent more as an individual than anybody else in the United States has ever spent on this subject.

For you to say, you know, in public that you believe in UFOs and aliens?

I don't care.

You don't worry that some people will say that you hear that guy, he sounds like he's crazy.

I don't care.

Why not?

It's not going to make a difference. It's not going to change reality of what I know.

Do you imagine that in our space travels we will encounter other forms of intelligent life?

You don't have to go anywhere. You can find it here.

Yeah.

Where exactly?

It's just like right under people's noses.

Oh my gosh. Wow.

The alloys would provoke many questions from the media and they would go on to become a centerpiece of the discussion going forward. The idea that we have pieces of a UFO would seem to indicate that not only is the phenomenon real, but that there's also tangible physical proof that something from outside of this world is currently visiting us.

But for our purposes here, what many commentators noted after the publishing of the New York Times article was that UFOs suddenly became a serious media talking point going forward. And this trend is continued well into the present day. While media interest in the subject has waxed and waned over the past few years since those last days of 2017, the subject does continue to be taken seriously by the media and by our elected officials.

In 2019 and going into 2020, both the Navy and then later the Department of Defense confirmed that yes, they really did release those videos from the original New York Times article. And that yes, they really did depict what they considered to be unidentified aerial phenomenon.

For those of you who haven't been paying attention to this subject, that's the new term for UFOs.

Even President Trump began to hint at the idea of UFO disclosure in a campaign video with his son, Donald Trump Jr.

Finally, in the COVID relief bill that was passed at the end of 2020, provisions were included requiring the Department of Defense to tell Congress everything they knew about the phenomenon. This led to yet another flurry of media reports in May and going into June of 2021 as Congress was awaiting for the delivery of the report.

Once the report was dropped, it did end up confirming that out of the 144 confirmed incidents that the investigators gathered, only one could be explained. And that many of the documented incidents included encounters with objects that exhibited otherworldly flight characteristics.

In May of 2022, Congress held its first hearing on the subject in more than 50 years where many of these data points were corroborated by upper brass from the Department of Defense. And now Congress is demanding more answers and more reports while seeking to provide immunity to whistleblowers who wish to come forward from black budget programs related to the phenomenon.

Clearly, this subject is not going away anytime soon. And while again the media's attention tends to wax and wane over this subject, our elected officials from both sides of the aisle continue to pursue this subject and more and more data continues to be released that seems to indicate that something strange is indeed going on in our skies.

But let's back up for a second. What is a Christian ministry doing investigating this subject? Why am I, a Presbyterian minister, following this subject and subscribing to social media sites like Disclosed.tv as I alluded to in the beginning? What does this have to do with cults, religion, and theology?

Well, the reason why Cultish has chosen to produce this series is not only because it's an example of fringe beliefs entering into the mainstream discourse, but because it's also a subject that always provokes profound worldview questions.

For example, in a recent interview between Tucker Carlson and accomplished geneticist Dr. Gary Nolan, a man that we will consider in future episodes, the worldview questions entered into the center of their discussion towards the end of the interview.

How will the admission that we are not at the top of the food chain anymore change all the religions? Because one of the first questions that somebody's going to ask is, okay, well, if they do show up and want to talk with us, who is their God? How do they see?

Great question. And then everybody, every other religion will be looking for anything that anything like this says for a mirror of what they believe in. And they would just start a whole new series of arguments. So that is yet another thing or another reason why the government might feel a little hesitancy about bringing this kind of information forward.

So also in a groundbreaking documentary aired on Australia's national news entitled Need to Know, journalist Ross Coulthart concluded the program with statements from Dr. Gary Nolan and Republican Congressman Tim Burchette, speaking to the worldview implications of the UFO UAP subject.

Why do you think there is such hostility to the idea of investigating the possibility of non-human intelligent life?

Well, that would put us not at the top of the food chain, first of all. And from a religious point of view, it's a context clash that, okay, well, if these things exist and they're there, where do they fit in the hierarchy to angels and God?

I go out every night and I look at the stars and some of those stars, the actual light from those stars left that star before the time of Christ. I mean, that just is mind boggling to me. And to think that in the vastness of God's creation that we are the best he can do. I just don't buy that.

You see, the idea is that UFOs or UAPs cause human beings to question their fundamental assumptions. In fact, many surmise that this is one of the reasons why the government has covered up the UFO subject for so long, because the release of the information would so challenge our institutions, especially our religious institutions, that it would lead to social instability, boringness, and so on.

Social instability bordering on mass psychosis.

So also, in light of the 70 plus year cover up, if the government eventually did come clean, the fear would be that it would further erode the public's trust in the government.

So, if a subject that was relegated to conspiracy theorists and new age nut cases turned out to be true, what else could be true?

Remember my brother-in-law's question when the New York Times article dropped? Well, are people rioting in the streets yet?

Now, thankfully, as of yet, there has yet to be any rioting. There's no signs of mass psychosis in response to what the government's disclosed. In fact, on the contrary, the public has seemed to shrug off the headlines while patiently waiting for whatever the government might reveal next.

In other words, as of yet, it hasn't led to a worldview crisis. And as we go through this series, we will see that this is not a subject that Christians should shy away from or be afraid of.

On the contrary, because of the worldview questions and implications that this subject does provoke, it begs for a thoughtful Christian response.

Now, as for myself, the Presbyterian minister who follows the UFO subject, I was one of those conspiracy theorists, and I was one of those new age cranks before the Lord saved me back in 2005. And yet, having researched this subject for years, I knew for a fact that there was something to it, even if my interpretation of the subject had drastically changed in light of my newfound faith in Christ.

And I had a gut feeling that it was just a matter of time before the culture would shift on this subject so that the government would be forced to acknowledge something about the phenomenon.

And while people have yet to riot in the streets or fall into a state of mass psychosis over UFO disclosure, it does seem as if we are moving towards some sort of paradigm shift surrounding this subject.

In the summer of 2021, just months after the congressional report on UAPs was released, Gallup reported that 41% of adults now believe that some UFOs and that some UAPs involve alien spacecraft from other planets, which was up 8 points from 33% back in 2019. And it isn't a stretch to assume that that number will continue to climb higher as this process continues.

As Dr. Diana Pasulka, professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina observed, belief in alien life and belief in UFOs constitutes a new form of what she calls religiosity.

In other words, while belief in UFOs or UAPs can certainly inspire cults and cult-like thinking, there's a mainstreaming of belief in alien contact that is not only permeating our social consciousness, but which is also fundamentally transforming what everyday people believe is and isn't possible.

As Dr. Pasulka states in her book American Cosmic, belief in alien contact has become respectable in our society simply because it's built around a supposition of future possibility.

In other words, unlike religions that are dependent upon the credibility of some past revelation, which can be subject to historical scrutiny, belief in alien contact and all that it may entail is seen as being more plausible and credible precisely because it has the potential of becoming a future event.

So for example, while belief in the reality of Christ is dependent upon past historical accounts, belief in alien visitation can be denied in the present and even in the past, but it can be anticipated as being likely in the future.

It's assumed that because we evolved as a species, then most likely many other species have evolved ahead of us and so it's simply a matter of time before we make contact with them and can learn from them.

Dr. Pasulka's observations are particularly interesting because she has cultivated relationships with NASA scientists and with intelligence operatives who not only believe that UFOs or UAPs are real, but who also claim to have had direct contact with the phenomenon, direct contact which has led them to make groundbreaking discoveries in science and in technology while also leading them to alter their spiritual beliefs and their beliefs.

So okay, NASA employees who claim life-altering alien contact, disclosure that's slowly being dripped from the Pentagon to the media and to Congress and all of this being originally spearheaded by a punk rocker who once wrote a song entitled Aliens Exist.

It's a lot to take in and it makes one wonder who's behind all of this? What's the agenda? Where is it all heading? And what are we as Christians to make of all of this?

This is what we will be exploring in this series that we've entitled An Alien Revelation, A History of UFO Disclosure.

As we will see, the current disclosure process has been not decades in the making, but centuries in the making. And it's deeply embedded in the world of the occult, the intelligence community, and in the early years of the space race and the development of NASA.

So to really get the full picture of where this is coming from and where it is headed and where we're going, we're going to begin back a few centuries and consider medieval magicians and Protestant heretics who claimed themselves to receive alien revelations through their experience with occult practices.

That's where we will begin in our second episode as we consider the sorcerer and the seer.
