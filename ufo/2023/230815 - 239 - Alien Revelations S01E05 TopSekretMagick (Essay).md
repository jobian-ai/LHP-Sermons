# The Secret Management of Magic

Throughout history, governments have tried to control things they didn't fully understand. But perhaps no effort has been more fascinating than the U.S. government's apparent decades-long attempt to manage what could only be called magic - the UFO phenomenon.

The story centers around something called Majestic 12 (or MJ-12), an alleged secret government group formed in 1947 to study UFOs. The existence of this group emerged through documents that showed up mysteriously in 1984, sent to a filmmaker named Jamie Shandera. These documents described a shadowy committee of 12 high-ranking officials, appointed by President Truman, tasked with investigating UFOs while keeping the public in the dark.

What's interesting isn't just whether MJ-12 existed, but how information about it emerged. The documents themselves are a puzzle - they contain details so precise that they seem legitimate, yet also have problems that make them look fake. The signature of President Truman appears to be copied from another document. The typewriter used may be from the wrong era.

But here's the curious part: if the documents are fake, they're an incredibly sophisticated fake. Whoever created them would need intimate knowledge of government operations, access to classified materials, and understanding of minor administrative details from the 1940s and 50s. A teenager in their basement couldn't have done this. Even most government employees couldn't have done this.

The most likely explanation is that the documents were created by intelligence agencies themselves. But why would they do this? 

The answer appears in a scene from a 1994 movie called Roswell, where a character explains the strategy: mix real information with disinformation, and release accurate information through questionable sources. This creates what intelligence agencies call "plausible deniability" - the ability to reveal something while maintaining the option to deny it later.

It's like a game of three-card monte, but with reality itself. The government appears to be simultaneously revealing and concealing information about UFOs, creating a situation where the truth is visible but never quite provable.

This pattern keeps repeating. In 2022, former Air Force Special Agent Richard Doty admitted on radio that he ran psychological operations involving UFO researchers. He would feed them real information mixed with false information. The same pattern appears in how Hollywood handles UFO stories - mixing fact and fiction in ways that make the truth harder to pin down.

What's emerging now, as more government officials speak openly about UFOs, is that this strategic ambiguity may have been deliberate policy. Luis Elizondo, who ran the Pentagon's recent UFO program, has hinted at the existence of MJ-12-like groups. Congress is starting to ask questions about secret programs studying UFO technology.

But perhaps the most interesting aspect is why the government would handle the subject this way. One theory is that it allows for gradual public acclimation while maintaining control. If people react badly to UFO revelations, everything can be walked back as fiction or conspiracy theories. If people accept it, more information can be released.

This approach creates a kind of psychological control. By never providing complete answers, it keeps both researchers and the public in a state of perpetual uncertainty and seeking. It's like having part of a jigsaw puzzle - you keep looking for the missing pieces, but you're never sure if the pieces you have are even real.

The UFO story suggests something fascinating: that when confronted with things it can't explain, even the most powerful government in the world resorts to managing perceptions rather than facts. It's not just controlling information - it's controlling magic.

What's ironic is that this modern approach mirrors how medieval authorities handled mysterious phenomena. They too tried to control both the reality and the narrative around things they didn't understand. The main difference is that instead of using church authority and religious doctrine, today's government uses classification systems and strategic information release.

The question isn't just whether UFOs are real, but whether we're capable of handling the truth about them directly. The government's approach suggests they think we're not - or at least, that we weren't for many decades. But as more information emerges, we may finally be reaching a point where the truth can be discussed openly, without the need for psychological operations and strategic ambiguity.

Yet even as this happens, we should remember that the pattern of mixing truth and fiction has created a landscape where certainty itself is hard to find. In trying to manage magic, we may have created a different kind of magic - one made of information rather than phenomena, but no less mysterious for that.
