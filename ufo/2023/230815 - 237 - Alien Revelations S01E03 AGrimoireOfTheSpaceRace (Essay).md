# The Rocket Wizard

Something strange happened in Southern California after World War II. A brilliant rocket scientist named Jack Parsons helped create what would become NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Without his work, we wouldn't have modern rockets or space travel. But Parsons had another side - he was deeply involved in the occult.

This might seem bizarre to us now. How could someone be both a cutting-edge scientist and a practitioner of magic? But this combination has a long history. In the 1500s, John Dee was both Queen Elizabeth's scientific advisor and someone who claimed to communicate with angels through magic rituals. The pattern keeps repeating: serious technical work mixed with mystical practices.

Parsons took this combination to a new level. While developing revolutionary rocket fuels during the day, he would spend his evenings performing magical rituals he learned from Aleister Crowley, the notorious occultist. The FBI even had a file on him, describing his house as the headquarters of a "religious cult" that advocated "sexual perversion."

What's really interesting is how many of the early space program pioneers shared this dual interest in technology and the occult. Edgar Mitchell, the sixth person to walk on the moon, tried to send psychic messages back to Earth during his Apollo mission. Adrian Clark, who helped develop the Saturn V rocket, wrote books about psychokinesis and consciousness expansion.

This pattern continues today. In her book American Cosmic, Dr. Diana Pasulka describes meeting a senior NASA scientist who believes he receives technological innovations through psychic contact with non-human intelligences. He has specific protocols for receiving these "downloads" - precise sleep schedules, sun exposure, hydration levels.

Why does this combination keep appearing? One theory is that pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the physical world naturally leads people to question other boundaries. When you're trying to figure out how to escape Earth's gravity, maybe it becomes easier to believe in escaping other limitations too.

But I think there's something else going on. The people who make fundamental breakthroughs often have to be a bit crazy. They have to be willing to believe things that everyone else thinks are impossible. Sometimes that willingness to believe the impossible spills over into other areas.

Consider someone in 1920 saying they could build a rocket that would take people to the moon. That would have seemed as crazy as claiming to talk to angels. Yet one of those turned out to be possible. Maybe this is why so many pioneers of rocketry were also interested in the occult - they needed that capacity for impossible beliefs to do their scientific work.

This suggests something counterintuitive: maybe being too rational can actually hold you back. If you only believe things that seem reasonable, you'll never try anything truly revolutionary. The trick is to be irrational enough to attempt the impossible, but rational enough to figure out which impossible things might actually be possible.

Parsons died young in a laboratory explosion. We'll never know if he was working on rocket fuel or performing a magical ritual when it happened. In a way, that ambiguity perfectly captures his legacy - a brilliant scientist who believed in magic, who helped create both modern rocketry and a strand of California counterculture that continues to influence us today.

Looking at figures like Parsons makes me wonder what impossible things we're dismissing today that might turn out to be possible tomorrow. And it makes me wonder if the capacity to believe in magic - even if it's not real - might sometimes help people achieve things that seem equally magical to everyone else.
