# The Control System

There's something unsettling about how UFOs behave. They don't act like spacecraft from another planet should. They break the laws of physics, moving in ways that would destroy any physical craft. They appear and disappear. They change shape. And strangest of all, they seem to affect people's minds.

I've been studying the work of Jacques Vallee, who noticed these patterns while working with J. Allen Hynek on Project Blue Book in the 1960s. Vallee isn't your typical UFO researcher. He's a computer scientist who helped create the internet's predecessor ARPANET. He's still active in Silicon Valley as a venture capitalist. But his UFO research led him to a startling hypothesis: UFOs might be part of a control system for human consciousness.

The idea sounds crazy until you look at the evidence. Throughout history, people have reported encounters with strange beings and craft that seem to adapt to each era's expectations. In medieval times, people saw fairies and demons. In the 1890s, they saw steampunk-style airships. Today we see flying saucers and gray aliens. The details change but the core phenomenon remains consistent - impossible physics, consciousness effects, and a mix of reality and absurdity that makes the whole thing hard to take seriously.

Vallee compares it to a thermostat. Just as a thermostat regulates temperature by sensing conditions and making adjustments, this phenomenon seems to regulate human consciousness by presenting different faces throughout history. It introduces new ideas and archetypes through encounters that are just real enough to affect people deeply, but just absurd enough to be dismissed by mainstream society.

This matches what we know about how paradigm shifts happen. The early scientists of the Renaissance claimed inspiration from angelic encounters. The Rosicrucians spoke of riding a "time wave of consciousness." Even today's government UFO researchers, in books like Skinwalkers at the Pentagon, describe the phenomenon as driving a shift from materialist to consciousness-based models of reality.

What makes this particularly interesting is that it's not just Vallee's personal theory. He describes an "Invisible College" of scientists who've studied the phenomenon and reached similar conclusions. Many of those involved in current UFO disclosure efforts share this perspective.

But here's the really unsettling part: what if this control system isn't benevolent? Vallee himself hints at this in his book Messengers of Deception. Perhaps the goal isn't enlightenment but confusion. Perhaps we're being steered away from truth rather than toward it.

This raises uncomfortable questions about consciousness and reality that most researchers prefer to avoid. But we can't understand the UFO phenomenon without confronting them. The phenomenon seems designed to shape how we think while hiding its true nature. That's what makes it both fascinating and disturbing.

Is this proof that we're being manipulated by non-human intelligence? Not necessarily. But it suggests that treating UFOs as simple extraterrestrial visitors misses the deeper pattern. There's something stranger going on - something that challenges our assumptions about consciousness, reality, and who or what might be trying to influence human development.

The question isn't just whether UFOs are real. The question is: what are they trying to do to us? And should we let them?
