# INTRO

I don't think it's bird, I don't think it's bug. I think it's exactly what a UFO stands for, unidentified flying object.

We did discover and explore many, many things in ways that frankly at the beginning look almost like a miracle. And then as we go forward, it looks like something new we never would have guessed.

Hey, hey! Unexplained sightings of flying objects in the sky for decades. The space agency launching a new team to investigate who or what may be behind the unexplained sightings.

Just last month, this video shot on an iPhone during an air show in Miami appears to show something shooting up out of the water with people swimming nearby.

Of unidentified aerial phenomena, UAP, or what we all call unidentified flying objects.

When I saw it, I was like, what in the, like no way!

The UAP is a new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new.

# PODCAST

You are listening to an Alien Revelation, the history of UFO disclosure. This is Episode 6, The Invisible Coach.

Look at this! Oh my God! Wow! Look at this! Uh, look, I want to talk to the man in charge.

Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority. He isn't even an American.

Mr. Nérie, are you an artist? Mr. Nérie, are you an artist? Or a painter?

No.

What do you believe in your ideas?

They are persistent.

You're hearing a persistent ringing in your ears.

How do you know?

Almost an agreeable ringing.

No.

Have you had any headaches? Migrains?

Yeah.

Irritation of the eyes and the nose? An irritation in your eyes and your sinuses?

Yeah.

Do you have any allergies? Do you have hives? Do you have allergies?

A debris on the visage and on the core? You're burning on your face and on your body?

Yes.

Who are you people?

The audio clip you just heard is from Steven Spielberg's 1977 classic, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The main character, Roy Nérie, who is played by Richard Dreyfuss, is being interrogated by two members of an international body that is studying the UFO phenomenon. Dreyfuss' character, Roy Nérie, along with many others, have received telepathic impressions from the UFO phenomenon of the Devil's Tower in eastern Wyoming, and they have broken a government quarantine in order to try to approach the national monument in following these impulses that have been placed within their minds.

And as you probably noticed from the clip, one of the officials interrogating him because of his breach of the quarantine is a French scientist named Claude Lacombe, who requires an interpreter in order to question Mr. Nérie. Now, Claude Lacombe is a central figure in the movie, who really propels the narrative along, as he is the leading scientist of an international body that is seeking to understand the UFO phenomenon worldwide. And it's a well-known fact that Mr. Lacombe is actually based upon a real scientist and a real UFO researcher who is alive today, another Frenchman who is named Jacques Velais, a man who will largely be the subject of this episode.

Now, just to give you some background on Jacques Velais, Jacques Velais was born on September 24, 1939 in France. After completing his undergraduate and graduate work in France, his first job began in 1961 as an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. Upon witnessing a UFO while working as an astronomer, he began to research the phenomenon as a side hobby. Later in 1962, he would move to the United States and he would be hired to compile the first detailed map of Mars for NASA. He would then later move to Northwestern University, where he would work on his PhD in industrial engineering and in computer science. But it was at Northwestern University that he would also continue to pursue his research into UFOs and would become a close friend and colleague of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the chief scientific advisor for the Air Force's study into UFOs, also known as Project Blue Book, the project we spoke about two episodes prior to this episode.

And while Velais would continue to pursue a successful career in artificial intelligence and in computer science, even helping the Department of Defense to start the first iterations of the Internet, a system known as the ARPANET, Dr. Velais would continue to devote much of his free time to the study of UFOs, which is what he is largely known for, though he does continue to be a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley to this day. And much of that time in researching UFOs would initially be spent again with Dr. J. Allen Hynek while he was working for the Air Force and as he was transitioning out of working for the Air Force to study the phenomenon independently.

Now, just to remind you, Dr. Hynek was an astronomer, and he was hired by the Air Force to largely debunk the UFO phenomenon, a fact that he would later speak out against after the closure of Project Blue Book. Hynek actually makes his own cameo appearance in Close Encounters of the Third Kind during the famous alien contact scene at the Devil's Tower monument at the very end of the movie.

But you see, because of his academic interest in computer science, Hynek would utilize Velais' expertise as a systems analyst to help catalog and analyze the frequency and the pattern of UFO sightings. This is a role that Velais has continued to fulfill for the government and for government contractors as the database generated through the ATIP program, the program that the New York Times broke the story about in 2017, that database was engineered by Jacques Vallee. So he is still very much involved with this subject at an official level.

But you see, it was in the late 1960s, while working with Dr. Hynek, that both Vallee and Hynek would come to some rather striking conclusions about the nature of the UFO phenomenon based upon Vallee's analysis through the databases that he assembled. These conclusions would lead to Vallee writing several groundbreaking works related to the UFO subject. Books like Passport to Magonia, Dimensions, A Casebook of Alien Contact, Revelations, Alien Contact and Human Deception, Messengers of Deception, and The Invisible College, along with several other titles.

Passport to Magonia is in many ways Vallee's seminal work in articulating his understanding of the UFO phenomenon. Now, Passport to Magonia is an interesting book because it is literally a book that can be judged by its cover. First, the title Passport to Magonia is a reference to medieval lore about a cloud realm where fairies and other spirits were said to have dwelled in, again, medieval lore. Vallee even cites a legend from France where citizens reported to church authorities that they were taken up into the clouds by strange beings, an account that sounds a lot like modern accounts of alien abductions. And this account was attributed by the locals to the fairies and to the spirits from Magonia. Hence why Vallee titled the book Passport to Magonia.

So also, on the cover of modern editions of Passport to Magonia, there's a depiction of the typical grey alien holding up three different masks. The mask of a 1950s space alien, the mask of a medieval demon, and the mask of a beautiful fairy-like creature. And both the title and the cover art do a good job at conveying exactly what Vallee has concluded about the UFO phenomenon.

You see, both Vallee and Hynek would come to the conclusion that not only were UFOs real, but that they seem to operate in a way that is a bit stranger than one would expect from intelligent life originating in outer space. As Vallee and Hynek observed, UFOs would regularly break almost all of the currently known laws of physics. They would perform accelerations that would pulverize any living creature, or make breakneck turns that would disintegrate the body of any craft moving through the air, along with other strange flight dynamics, like their ability to operate silently, while also not engaging with the environment in any sort of typical fashion that we would expect.

A contemporary example of these strange flight characteristics would be what Trump's Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, described on Fox News in the summer of 2021 before the UFO report was delivered to Congress in June of that year.

When we talk about sightings, we're talking about objects that have been seen by Navy or Air Force pilots, or have been picked up by satellite imagery that frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain, that movements that are hard to replicate, that we don't have the technology for, or traveling at speeds that exceed the sound barrier without a sonic boom. So, in short, things that we are observing that are difficult to explain.

You see, moving faster than the speed of sound and not creating a sonic boom, or diving underwater without creating a splash, as many Navy witnesses have testified to, this seems to indicate some form of technology that is disjointed from physical reality as we know it. And while many could argue that this is just super advanced physics as developed by a highly evolved alien species, experts like Hynek and Valais cast doubt upon such a hypothesis.

You see, not only do UFOs move in strange ways, but they also behave much like the apparitions and the apports that are said to occur during seances and during occult rituals, seances and occult rituals that men like Dee, Crowley, and Parsons would engage in. In fact, this is a parallel that Valais addresses in his book, The Invisible College. He writes, quote, No theory of UFOs can be deemed acceptable if it does not account for the reported psychic effects produced by these objects. By psychic effects, I refer to the space-time distortions experienced by recipients of craft-like devices which appear or fade away on the spot in ways that are reminiscent of descriptions of materializations in the spiritualist literature. End quote.

So also, UFOs have been known to change shape in mid-air or to break up into pieces and then fly off into several different directions. This doesn't seem to be the behavior of physical craft, but especially the psychic effects of UFOs are what Valais and Hynek found interesting. This is an aspect of the phenomenon that leads to some discussion in the book that they co-wrote together, The Edge of Reality.

You see, those who encounter UFOs seem to consistently report profound psychological and spiritual changes simply from observing the phenomenon even at a distance. Of course, those who claim to have encountered the beings associated with the objects, or those who have claimed to actually have entered into one of the objects, they find it to be a profound and life-changing event. But even those who perceive it again from a distance experience effects that can only be likened to mystical states and to a form of religious conversion. Some even report hearing strange voices and odd buzzings, and later report to encounter paranormal phenomenon in their homes. They often report that new thoughts come into their mind, and they're inspired with new ideas after having encountered a UFO.

In their book Skinwalkers at the Pentagon, DoD scientists James Lakatsky and Colm Kelleher, two men who worked on the ATIP program and whose book is officially marked as being approved for release by the Pentagon, they recount how the pilots in some of these recent military encounters that we've all heard of later claimed that poltergeist phenomenon followed them and visited them in their homes.

But this is something that Vilay and Hynek recognized in the 1960s and in the 1970s, that there seems to be a connection between spiritual phenomenon and occult phenomenon, and the phenomenon that has come to be known as UFOs. Remember Wilbert Smith's memo to the Canadian government when he said that the US government was studying this phenomenon in relation to quote, mental phenomena? Vilay and Hynek found a similar connection as well in their research.

This is why Vilay titled his seminal work Passport to Magonia, because the phenomenon seemed to be reintroducing the enchanted world of magic back into the modern world. It was a modern passport back into Magonia, back into the medieval lore of fairies and elves and sylphs. But especially when Vilay began examining historical accounts of angels, demons, fairies, and sylphs, did he see a striking parallel between the UFO phenomenon and ancient encounters with spirit entities?

For example, it is well known in the Middle Ages that people reported encounters with incubi and succubi, spirits that would come into people's bedrooms at night and engage in sexual activity with them. Often, these beings would claim to have sired hybrid children with their human victims, entities known in medieval lore as changelings. Even Saint Augustine lends credence to these reports in the city of God. So also, fairies were said to have illuminated houses that would float through the air and move from place to place, while also telling those that they had direct encounters with that they came from a realm that parallels our own world, a realm that is invisible to the naked eye. Again, a realm that some in the medieval world called Magonia, as well as other places like fairyland.

But especially the airship sightings of the late 19th century would grab Vilay's attention, as the airship sightings of the late 19th century seem to be a fusion of fairy lore with our developing theories about life on Mars and life on other planets. You see, across the American West in the late 1800s and over major cities like Sacramento, California, thousands of witnesses would claim to see bizarre, steampunk-like airships similar to Bowser's floating ship from the Mario franchise, floating above their cities and floating through the night sky. In fact, many would claim to see and speak with the pilots of these devices, who would claim to be from Mars and from other places in outer space. Often the ships would slowly float above the cityscape, only to abruptly turn and then shoot off like a bullet.

And so in Vilay's eyes, this appears to be the same phenomenon reported in modern UFO encounters. But the ships, the inhabitants, and the self-professed origin of the inhabitants seem to match, again, the cultural expectations and the technological imagination of the time, even if the technology behaved in impossible ways. Vilay even tracks how modern flying saucer encounters seem to mirror the expectations of the culture, as our ideas of what spaceships and of what alien life would look like continued to change. You can see that flying saucers in the 1930s and in the 1940s and in the 1950s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, while they would all perform these impossible movements, yet their appearance would mirror the cultural expectations of the time.

This observation, along with other observations, is what led Vilay to develop his control system hypothesis, a hypothesis that we will get to in a moment. But this observation of the changing face of the phenomenon is also what's behind the various masks that the gray is holding on the cover of Passport to Magonia. The idea is that the phenomenon manifests itself in different ways throughout history, again to meet the cultural expectations of the people at the time.

In fact, Gary Nolan, a man whom we have mentioned in prior episodes, a man who has been contracted with the intelligence world to study the phenomenon, made this very point on the Lex Friedman podcast.

I mean, if you go back to the whole notion of, okay, how long has this been around? It didn't just start showing up in 1947, right? There are stories going back, you know, into the 1800s of people who saw things in their farming, in their farm fields in the US. It's in local newspapers from the 1800s. It's fascinating. But if you can go even further back, you know, so to your point of how would you as a higher intelligence represent yourself to a lesser intelligence? Well, let's go back to pre-civilization. Maybe you show yourself as the spirits in the forest, and you give messages through that. Once you get a little bit more civilized, then you show yourself as the gods. And then you're God. Well, we don't believe in God anymore necessarily. Not everybody does. So what do we believe in? We believe in technology. So you show yourself as a form of technology.

And so in summarizing these findings and conclusions about how the phenomenon operates, Valet makes five observations about the UFO phenomenon towards the end of his book Dimensions. He writes, quote,

1. UFO reports are not necessarily caused by visits from space travelers.

2. The phenomenon could be a manifestation of a much more complex technology.

3. If consciousness can be manifested outside the body, then the range of hypotheses can be even wider.

4. The key to an understanding of the phenomenon lies in the psychic effects it produces or the psychic awareness it makes possible in its observers. Their lives are often deeply changed, and they develop unusual talents with which they may find it difficult to cope.

5. Contact between the human recipients and the UFO phenomenon always occurs under conditions controlled by the latter. Its characteristic feature is a factor of absurdity that leads to a rejection of the story by the upper layers of the target society and an absorption at a deep, unconscious level of the symbols conveyed by the encounter.

Now that last point is interesting because it's an observation that the UFO phenomenon is operating in a similar way as the alleged MJ-12 group operates that we examined in our previous episode. The phenomenon seems to mix reality with fiction. It seems to mix truth with absurdity so that the story and the ideas spread, but only with a grain of salt and only in a measured fashion. Again, as Valet says, its characteristic feature is a factor of absurdity that leads to a rejection of the story by the upper layers of the target society and an absorption at a deep, unconscious level of the symbols conveyed by the encounter.

In fact, Valet also observes in that section of Dimensions that this mischievousness of the phenomenon fits right in with popular conceptions of the Devil. And so, Valet concludes that the phenomenon is more likely interdimensional rather than extraterrestrial, and that it has something to do with human consciousness. Specifically, it seems to want to shape and reshape human consciousness throughout history.

And so this is where his control system hypothesis comes in. In his other book, The Invisible College, Valet compares the UFO phenomenon to a thermostat for consciousness. Now, as he reminds us, a thermostat adjusts the temperature of a room or of a building to the temperature needs of a human body based upon the conditions outside. So, for example, if you set the indoor temperature for 69 degrees, in the summer the thermostat will turn on the air conditioning, and in the winter it will turn on the heater to varying degrees based upon the outside temperature in relation to that inside temperature that you have set the thermostat to. The thermostat does the work of managing what needs to be done in order to regulate our environment in various conditions.

And so the idea is, according to Valet, that the UFO phenomenon functions like a thermostat, which over time regulates man's consciousness and his relationship to his environment, and how man perceives his relationship to his environment, and that this occurs by presenting to man new ideas and new archetypes through these subtle and yet subversive encounters that have been occurring throughout history.

To just flesh this out and to put some meat on those bones, just think back to where we have come so far since our first few episodes. We saw that many of the earlier scientists and mathematicians of the Renaissance and of the Enlightenment era were into the occult, and they claimed to have encounters with entities that they thought were angels, entities which inspired them and gave them new ideas and carried them along in their work. Again, this is what the Rosicrucians and the Invisible College were all about. Remember Dr. Diana Pasulka when she said that they believed that they are riding some sort of time wave of consciousness.

So, terracism refers to a tradition of knowledge, production, and transmission that is focused on truths that are not public and that are hidden. So, it's a tradition of hidden knowledge. Who are the Rosicrucians? Members of this order attempt to align themselves with what they deem important and perennial truths, and from what I can surmise, they surf while at the same time study a time wave that seems to have a life of its own, its own autonomy, like the Tao. A tenet of this order is that this knowledge is democratically available to all who have the inclination, inspiration, and capacity to study it. It does not discriminate with respect to money, credentials, or insider information.

And as you've heard me cite it a few times now, one of Jacques Vallee's books, which is about the group of scientists who have been studying this phenomenon behind closed doors, the title of the book is The Invisible College, named after this group of scientists that Vallee calls the Invisible College. So, Vallee does indeed see a connection between the UFO phenomenon and what it's doing to shift human consciousness, the government officials and the members of academia who are studying it and seeking to slowly make their findings public, and what the Rosicrucians and early scientists and occultists were seeking to do in bringing about a new era of learning and scientific progress. And as, again, Dr. Diana Pasulka pointed out in her lecture at Rice University, these groups have seen themselves as riding a time wave of consciousness that's leading to a paradigm shift amongst mankind.

Specifically, Vallee sees these forces aligning themselves together in bringing about a paradigm shift, a paradigm shift where the post-enlightenment bifurcation between science and the spirit will eventually be dissolved. In an interview with Jesse Michaels, this very issue was brought up by Mr. Michaels in speaking with Mr. Vallee.

Because I think about this science and the spirit have been bifurcated since the Enlightenment, and you named your group the Invisible College in the 70s studying UFOs and sort of I know you're interested in Rosicrucianism. Do you think we could re-merge the science and the spirit in the form of UFO based religion where it's both science and technology?

It already happened. I wrote one of the books, I wrote, The Sessions of Deception, and I have a book where I went around for a while looking at little UFO religions.

In other words, Vallee does see ufology as having many cultish implications. And as we saw in episode two from this series, this can even be tied to the history of movements like Mormonism and Swedenborgianism. And so at some level we do have to admit that Vallee is right in observing that the UFO phenomenon has influenced human culture and human consciousness. As I mentioned in a prior episode, the UFO phenomenon itself seems to be orchestrating this shift in consciousness to where mass culture is slowly being prepared to acknowledge the existence of the phenomenon.

Now all of this may seem interesting, but it can be tempting to think that, well, this is just one man's theory, as interesting and as credible as he might be. However, in his book, The Invisible College, Vallee alludes to the fact that there is a whole network of scientists working on this, many of whom were associated with J. Allen Hynek's original research in the 60s and 70s. And he says that his thesis about the UFO phenomenon as a control system for human consciousness is actually the collective findings of this invisible college. And this is a thesis that many of those who are currently pushing for UFO disclosure not only subscribe to, but they also claim that decades of research since Vallee published his book has only gone on to confirm the contours of this control system hypothesis.

In fact, Tom DeLonge and those who work with Tom DeLonge have all spoken in favor of this understanding of what the UFO phenomenon is up to. And speaking on the Ezra Klein show, former President Barack Obama was questioned about the significance of UAPs, and he even acknowledged that one of the fallouts surrounding the disclosure of hardcore evidence for the existence of alien life would be the formation of new religions. And so again, those in power do seem to be privy to this effect of the phenomenon on human consciousness at some level.

In many ways, Jacques Vallee has sort of become the patron saint of modern UFO disclosure, as his ideas seem to permeate discussions around the subject, both from within and outside of the US government. In the book Skinwalkers at the Pentagon, the book that I mentioned earlier, the DoD scientists who were tasked to study this subject through ATIP surveyed how the phenomenon has changed its contours, even throughout its modern expression since 1947. They conclude their survey at the end of the book mirroring Vallee's control system hypothesis, saying

They then go on to describe how a profound shift is occurring in Western culture, where we are moving away from a materialistic view of reality towards an idealistic view of reality, where consciousness has the primacy over material reality. So again, this mirrors many of the themes that Vallee has observed.

And from a biblical perspective, while we might not agree with the presuppositions of Jacques Vallee and the Invisible College on everything that they say, what they do observe about the nature of the UFO phenomenon is plausible from a biblical perspective. For example, we are told in scripture that there are indeed spirit entities that interact with this world from a parallel dimension of reality. In 2 Kings 6, Elisha prays for a young man's eyes to be opened so that he might see the Lord's angelic armies protecting them as they were being surrounded by their enemies. Again, the angels were there, they just weren't visible to normal human sight. And throughout scripture, we see that such a realm exists, and that it interacts with the goings on of this world.

So also, we are informed in scripture that there are indeed demons who seek to inspire false doctrines, and they seek to lead men and women astray. We are warned specifically in 1 Timothy chapter 4 that in the last days many will follow after doctrines of demons, and we are repeatedly warned that Satan and that his hosts are capable of performing false signs and lying wonders, in order to promote false teaching, and in order to seduce the souls of men into a false religion or into a false view of the world that does not lead them to worship God as all men are commanded to do.

Even Jacques Vallee in his book, Messengers of Deception, seems to hint that much of this so-called control system is deceptive, or at least dishonest in nature. Perhaps the thermostat is being set to blind men from the truth, to use his analogy. Indeed, when Paul says in Ephesians chapter 2 that when we were dead in trespasses and sins that we were following the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works, and the sons of disobedience, that sounds like what can be described as a control system. When we were dead in trespasses and sins, we were under the control system of the enemy, of Satan himself.

And so this has led many Christian apologists like Gary Bates, Hugh Ross, Kenneth Samples, Gary North, and Walter Martin to see the UFO phenomenon as largely being part of a demonic deception, though of course other things could be going on as well in the realm of human manipulation and advanced technology.

So this group of scientists, this invisible college, many of whom were working with the government, were coming to conclusions that are much different than the ideas that are being put out through Hollywood movies, through UFO subculture, and through conspiracy conferences. It's a conclusion that is deeply disturbing to those who come from a secular mindset, yet for those who believe in scripture, and for those who submit to the crucified and risen Christ, the one who has triumphed over the principalities and powers, while this subject and what's been uncovered about it may indeed be disturbing, it's also nothing that we need to fear. Because again, Christ has triumphed over the principalities and powers, and we are secure in him if we are in him by faith.

But apparently those who were working in classified projects decided to go where angels and Christians fear to tread. They began using occult techniques to establish contact with the phenomenon, and they came to experience some very strange things. Things that they would only ever want to cover up and obfuscate before a general public that is largely composed of Christians and secularists.

And that's what we will consider in our next episode, which is entitled, Stranger Things.

# OUTRO

Oh my gosh. Wow! Surprise!
