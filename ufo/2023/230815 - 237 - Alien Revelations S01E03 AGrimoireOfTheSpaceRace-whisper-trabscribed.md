# INTRO

I don't think it's bird, I don't think it's bug. I think it's exactly what a UFO stands for, unidentified flying object.

We did discover and explore many, many things in ways that frankly at the beginning look almost like a miracle. And then as we go forward, it looks like something new we never would have guessed.

Hey, hey! Unexplained sightings of flying objects in the sky for decades. The space agency launching a new team to investigate who or what may be behind the unexplained site.

Just last month, this video shot on an iPhone during an air show in Miami appears to show something shooting up out of the water with people swimming nearby.

Of unidentified aerial phenomena, UAP, or what we all call unidentified flying objects.

And I saw it. I was like, what in the? Like, no way.

Check on 6-1-3. Roger. My good-bye. Take down.

We've ballistic into an alien revelation, the history of UFO disclosure. This is episode three, a good world of the space race.

Oh my gosh. Wow! Oh my gosh. It's bright.

Mr. Crowley. What went on in your head? Oh, Mr. Crowley.

# PODCAST

Our story will now fast forward to the 1940s in Southern California. The setting is the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, where John Dee's magic would pervade the life of the father of the modern rocket, a man known as Jack Parsons.

Now, to just pique your interest in this man and his relationship to all things cultish, here are some quotes from Air Force and FBI files on Mr. Parsons.

In a document dated May 17th, 1948, Parsons' residence was described as a quote, religious cult believed to advocate sexual perversion, which was organized at the subject's home at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, Pasadena, California, which has been reported subversive.

Even earlier in 1943, the FBI interviewed Parsons and according to official records, he stated that the Church of Thelema, which was held at his residence in Pasadena, was a lodge and fraternity as well as a church and that they studied philosophy as well as religion and attempted to inform themselves concerning all types and kinds of religion.

So what was the Church of Thelema and how does it connect to John Dee and what was the father of modern rocketry who even has a crater named after him on the moon doing by starting such an organization in his place of residence?

Well, the Church of Thelema gets its name from the Law of Thelema, which is a so-called moral law delivered to black magician Aleister Crowley by a spiritual entity whom he named Iwas, which he identified as his guardian angel.

Now, if you aren't familiar with him and if you didn't pay attention to our intro music, Aleister Crowley was perhaps the most well-known occultist of the 20th century. He was born in 1875 to parents who were devout followers of the Plymouth Brethren movement, the movement known for popularizing both dispensationalism as a interpretation of Bible prophecy as well as for popularizing a low view of the institutional church amongst Western Protestantism.

However, despite his devout Christian upbringing by Plymouth Brethren parents, Crowley would grow up to rebel against his parents' religion as he pursued a life of debauchery and occultism.

After attending Cambridge University in the late 1800s, he would be initiated into an occult organization known as the Order of the Golden Dawn. And it was here with the Order of the Golden Dawn where our subject for this episode, Jack Parsons, would find a historical link with the Enochian magic of John Dee.

You see, the Order of the Golden Dawn would be known as an organization that would rediscover the magic of John Dee and breathe new life into it into the 20th century. The Golden Dawn would in many ways incarnate the pursuit of the Renaissance cults and other alchemical organizations that we previously considered like the Rosicrucians, where the promise of a future scientific utopia was fused with magic and the occult and with contact with higher entities that identified themselves as angels.

In fact, Tobias Churton in his book on Lester Crowley entitled, A Lester Crowley in England, The Return of the Beast, described Crowley's pursuit as being partly inspired by advances in science, specifically advances in the realm of nuclear physics.

He writes, the movement in 20th century physics towards subatomic research where traditional notions of substance or stuff breaks down into series of paradoxical relationships and relative points encouraged his, that is Crowley's magical vision of a mind matter continuum, for he saw traditional rationalism breaking down also with increasing awareness of ulterior dimensions.

Tobias Churton also describes Crowley as a man who would go into periods of deep despair, which would permanently harm his health, yet he never entirely departed from his creed of faith in the gods who made what he called magic possible.

And those so-called gods would begin to reveal themselves to Crowley in the early years of the 20th century. As mentioned previously, while in Cairo, Egypt, he began to receive dictation from an entity known as Iwas, a dictation which would become known as the book of the law, a book that would claim to be ushering in a new age for humanity, an age that Crowley called the age of Horus, which would move humanity beyond the age of Christianity into a new age of occultism and scientific progress.

But what the book of the law would really become known for is the law of Thelema, which would be the moral code of the age of Horus, which was again summarized by the statement, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.

In other words, the law of Thelema encouraged a libertarian sense of moral freedom, where one can pursue any pleasure or any lifestyle, so long as it doesn't interfere with someone else's pursuit of pleasure in their self-designated lifestyle.

And it was a code that Crowley would live by as he lived a life of bisexuality, drug use, and as he engaged in other forms of moral debauchery that went along with his occultism.

And in many ways, we can say that this is now the moral code of the modern West, from the moral imperative at Woodstock, if it feels good, do it, to the secular libertarian creed that underlies many arguments in favor of the LGBTQ movement, the modern world is certainly marching according to Crowley's law of Thelema.

In fact, many popular musicians have practiced Crowley's magic and specifically credit him with providing an avenue for musical inspiration through contact with occult forces. Some even call Crowley the patron saint of rock and roll, hence Black Sabbath's ballad that we opened this podcast with.

So the law of Thelema is certainly at work in pop culture and in the modern world in general. And the law of Thelema was certainly at work in the life of Jack Parsons and his Church of Thelema in the 1940s, which as we previously mentioned, even the US government noted for its loose morals and countercultural practices.

But before we get back to Parsons and Crowley's influence on Parsons, just a few observations about Crowley himself. Remember in episode two, we noted that the so-called angels that John Dee was in contact with were upset with the human race, not only for their moral failures, but also for breaking up Christendom or the Holy Roman Empire. And so what the angels introduced to Dee was a new method of contact with themselves, which would lay the groundwork for a new global religion.

And so sure enough, at the beginning of the 20th century, this form of contact known as Enochian magic was continued through the order of the golden dawn. And then it was passed on to men like Aleister Crowley, who brought it to the masses through the occult revivals of the early 20th century. And like with John Dee, Crowley would claim that his ideas were directly inspired by the entities that he communed with, though Crowley had no pretensions of being a Christian, unlike John Dee and Edward Kelly.

In fact, Crowley often referred to himself as the great beast and was called by newspapers at the time, the quote, wickedest man alive. In many ways, Crowley introduced Enochian magic in spirit contact to the masses and not through the guise of a new form of Christianity, as in the case of Swedenborgianism and Mormonism. Instead, he would introduce it in the form of a countercultural revolution.

And that countercultural revolution would be sewn on American soil in Southern California through the work of Jack Parsons.

Now, to give you some background on Parsons, Jack Parsons was born in LA in 1914. And from a young age, he took interest in the concept of space exploration through his interest in the genre of science fiction. And so because of this interest, he would dedicate his life to the science of rocketry. And while he would drop out of Pasadena Junior College and Stanford University due to the financial hardships of the Great Depression, he would continue to work under contract with prestigious government laboratories in the realm of rocket science.

In fact, he would be one of the principal founders of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which continues to this day as a NASA laboratory known as NASA JPL in Pasadena, California. And as many historians of science have noted, we wouldn't have modern space rockets or intercontinental ballistic missiles if it wasn't for Jack Parsons and his scientific research.

In other words, no Jack Parsons and no NASA, no SpaceX and no Elon Musk.

But for our purposes in this podcast, what Parsons would also be known for is his dedication to Crowley's magic. And as I alluded to in the beginning, this would be so notorious that it would attract the attention of the US Air Force and the FBI.

In fact, Crowley himself would initially be quite impressed with Parsons, writing in a correspondence to a colleague saying, "Jack Parsons' sounds promising," while then reciting all sorts of astrological symbols that supposedly demonstrated his promise as an advanced occultist and magician.

In fact, Crowley himself would attempt to travel to Pasadena in 1942 to be with Parsons and with the Church of Thelema, though his passport would end up being denied.

But the high point of Parsons' career as a Thelemite would come in 1946 to 1947, when he would join with science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard in seeking to bring about Crowley's Age of Horus. This would involve Enochian magic and other bizarre rituals and practices that are not appropriate to recount in this podcast.

As Jason Louve recounts in his book, "John Dee and the Empire of Angels," these practices would lead to strange events like heavy wind storms and poltergeist phenomenon, unexplained knocking, a metallic and buzzing voice crying out, let me go free, along with other strange encounters at the Church of Thelema.

During this time, a woman named Marjorie Cameron would become involved with Parsons and Hubbard, with Parsons even dubbing her as the Scarlet Woman of the Book of Revelation, whom Parsons would later marry. The Babylon working rituals would be completed in February of 1946 in a ritual in the Mojave Desert that was attended by L. Ron Hubbard and Marjorie Cameron.

But what was particularly interesting about these bizarre rituals is that Cameron and others tied the Babylon working to the manifestation of the UFO phenomenon in the late 1940s. Upon returning home after the working was complete, Cameron would claim to witness a UFO, which she interpreted as a sign that the magic was working.

So also Kenneth Grant, who was an associate of Aleister Crowley, interpreted the initial UFO waves of 1947 as being directly related to the Babylon working. He would even reportedly say that, quote, something pierced the veil during the Babylon working, allowing this phenomenon to manifest itself.

So here we see an apparent connection between Dee's Anakian magic as mediated through Crowley, the beginning of the space race as inspired by Parsons, and the flood of UFO reports that would begin to pour in in the years and decades ahead.

And this connection hasn't gone unnoticed by those who study the UFO phenomenon. Dr. Diana Pasulka, the professor of religious studies from the University of North Carolina, whom I mentioned in previous episodes, tied Parsons' rituals to a form of alien contact during her interview with Lex Friedman.

If you look back at the history of our space programs, the viable space programs are both Russian and American, and each has an amazingly strange history because the founders of the calculations that got us up into space, the rocket scientists basically, were doing some pretty weird rituals and doing religious things, right? They weren't necessarily, like Jack Parsons on our side was out in the desert with people like L. Ron Hubbard and doing really intense rituals, believing that they were opening stargates and things like that, okay? And they were really doing that, okay?

So then you go to the Russian side and they had a very specific non-dogmatic, according to Catholics or Orthodox Christianity, idea of what Christianity was, and they believed that they were interacting with angels, okay, non-human intelligences.

In fact, in her book, American Cosmic, Dr. Pusilka mentions that Parsons would conduct experiments and launches on occult holidays like Halloween, and that he would perform special rituals before launching his test rockets. And as many other researchers have pointed out, some of Aleister Crowley's sketchings of the entities that he channeled during his rituals look strikingly similar to the grays from alleged alien abduction encounters. For reference, just Google Aleister Crowley and Lamb, that is L-A-M, and you'll see what I'm talking about.

So again, there appears to be a rather strong historical connection between the occult, the modern space race, and modern UFO encounters. This has even been recognized by Tom DeLonge in his Secret Machines nonfiction series. In the second book of their nonfiction series, DeLonge and his co-author Peter Lavenda observed, quote, Jack Parsons was quite familiar with the work of John D. and Edward Kelly, the two English magicians of the Elizabethan era who dabbled in ceremonial magic and mediumship. Parsons admitted that he employed their angelic system in his own occult workings, end quote.

Later on, DeLonge and Lavenda connect this contact to the very contact that we now regard as extraterrestrial contact or UFO contact. So you see, even those who are intimately involved with the current push to mainstream UFOs and UFO disclosure have recognized this connection between the Babylon working and the UFO phenomenon.

Now, after the Babylon working, Parsons would continue to develop his occult philosophy along with his rocket science, while also developing a libertarian philosophy of life that would anticipate the sexual revolution of the 1960s. However, due to his shady activities, the US government would end up eventually revoking his security clearance while also investigating him for foreign espionage.

Sadly, on June 17th, 1952, Parsons would die in a lab explosion under questionable circumstances. There are those who believe that rather than being an explosion due to his experiments in rocket science, that it was actually a magical ritual gone wrong that led to the explosion and his subsequent death.

But whatever the truth of the matter is, Parsons would be known for continuing the legacy of John Dee of the Invisible College and of the other Renaissance cults infusing scientific research with occult practices. And so it is quite fitting, if you think about it, that even in his death, that it's unclear whether science or the occult got the best of him.

And while Parsons would not live to see the discoveries and the horrors of his rocket science come to fruition through the space race and through the Cold War, yet his colleague L. Ron Hubbard would go on to start one of the wealthiest and most powerful Gnostic cults in history, the Church of Scientology. And while the Church of Scientology's official explanation of Hubbard's involvement with Parsons is that he was working on behalf of naval intelligence to investigate and break up the Church of Thelema, it's yet undeniable that Hubbard was deeply influenced by both science fiction and the occult, just as Parsons was.

In fact, even the name of his religion, Scientology, has undertones of scientific advancement being joined with spiritual practices. And of course, the Church of Scientology continues to have massive influence in Hollywood and in other segments of society.

With the fusion of occultism with space exploration and with the subject of UFOs would continue to be carried on through NASA and through other space exploration organizations going forward. For example, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, would openly pursue Eastern religions and New Age philosophies while seeking to develop his psychic abilities.

Mitchell would famously engage in experiments seeking to send thought messages to several participants on Earth while traveling to and from the moon during the Apollo 14 mission that he participated in. Mitchell would go on to be an advocate for UFO disclosure and would claim that through his connections in the government that he had convincing evidence that we were being visited by extraterrestrials and by other non-human intelligences.

However, it wasn't just Edgar Mitchell who continued this fusion of occultism with space exploration. Dr. Adrian Clark, a NASA scientist associated with the Skylab project and with the development of the Saturn V rocket, he would likewise explore consciousness expansion and occultism in accordance with the futuristic outlook that is inherent to space exploration.

In his book, Psychokinesis, Moving Matter with Mind, Clark lays out a systematic understanding of how religion, consciousness, and the future of technological development all relate to one another and all interpenetrate with one another. He theorized that psychokinesis is a technique that can be intuited and developed by those who are spiritually advanced where one can even learn to so control all the atoms in their body that they can move functionally from place to place by teleporting themselves.

In his book, Clark fuses this occult understanding with Christianity and he even theorizes that this is how Jesus could walk on water and appear in rooms with locked doors as he did in the resurrection accounts. He likewise theorized that this is how UFOs are able to engage in high speed, high G maneuvers without disintegrating or harming the pilots. According to him, it must be because all the atoms in the craft all self-propell and move together at once and are thus not subject to the forces of gravity or to the forces of inertia.

In line with his speculations about Jesus, the miracles of the Bible and reports of UFOs, he even speculated that there was a connection between the space program and humanity's spiritual development. Again, in his book, he says that quote, some people in contact with super intelligence are proposing that the space program is part of a master plan being carried out by the superior universal intelligence.

This would certainly seem to fit in with Parsons occultism and with the history of NASA's jet propulsion laboratory. He also speculated that UFOs may not be alien spacecraft after all, but are quote, only images projected into the physical world from the psychic world whose purpose is exactly the purpose which they serve. That is to arouse people to consider life on other planets of the universe, higher intelligence, spirit beings and communications with other worlds, end quote.

In other words, in Clark's view, UFOs serve the same purpose as the visions of Emanuel Swedenborg. They are there to expand human consciousness to consider a more expansive worldview that combines alien life and the future potential of space travel with occult practices and alternative spiritualities.

And as we will see in future episodes, men like Jacques Vallee have observed that the UFO phenomenon seems to actually serve that purpose, to expand man's consciousness, to consider other possibilities about the nature of reality.

And the fusion of space exploration with the realm of UFOs and the occult would continue into contemporary times. In Dr. Pazolka's book, American Cosmic, she narrates her contact with a NASA employee and intelligence operative whom she names Tyler after Tyler Durden from the movie Fight Club. Now, later in the series, we will talk more about Tyler and Pazolka's other contacts with the so-called invisible college. We will even identify who Tyler is. For those of you who can't wait and enjoy internet sleuthing, his identity has been uncovered because Pazolka says in her book that she went to the Vatican Observatory with him and those sign-in records are available publicly online.

But for our purposes in this episode, Dr. Pazolka recounts how Tyler has made scientific discoveries and has even developed many successful technologies through psychic contact with higher entities.

And so when I started to talk to people who were actually in the space program and who were in these programs that now the government has said, oh yeah, we do have these programs, they have the same belief structures. They believe that they were also in contact with these non-human intelligences and they were getting what they call downloads of information and creating, sometimes with Tyler D. in my book, creating technologies that were real and they were selling them on NASDAQ for a lot of money, like say $100 million or something like that, undisclosed amounts, but a lot. And these things are viable technologies that we use now and they make our lives better and we progress as a species because of them.

In her book, she quotes him as saying, humans are a type of satellite in fact. So in order to receive the signals and to transmit the signals, we have to tune our physical bodies in DNA. Because of this, I make sure I sleep really well. I use the eight plus one rule, that is I sleep for eight hours, wake up, and then make myself go back to bed for an hour. That one hour, the top off really makes or breaks my day. I barely drink alcohol as it interferes with sleep and I never drink coffee. Coffee really messes up the signal.

She says, I listened to Tyler as I sipped from my coffee, trying to fight the exhaustion that comes from cramming too many activities into a three-day conference. Jeff and I took turns asking Tyler more questions about his protocol and his connection to the off-planet intelligence. How does this help with your connection? And what does that connection feel like I asked?

He says, I also have to be in the sun and so I wake up and the previous night I will have gone to bed a little dehydrated. Then I get my extra hour of sleep and go out into the sun. While I bask in the light of vitamin D, I drink a tall glass of water, which flushes my cells and rehydrates them. This is better than coffee. It is at this point that I can usually feel the connection. I know I have established connection when the thoughts that show up in my mind don't seem like my own. They are unfamiliar. With practice, you can feel the difference.

And in multiple interviews, Pisolka has connected Tyler's contact protocols, as we just recounted, to the work of Jack Parsons, though she does add that Tyler would be horrified to learn of any such parallel between his protocols and the Babylon working of Parsons.

It is significant to point out that Tyler was in no way knowledgeable about the tradition in which he contributed. He was completely ignorant about the history and strange roots of the program within which he dedicated his whole life. This man was in the space program since I believe he was 18 years old. When I met him, he was 60. He'd been there his whole life and he didn't even know who Jack Parsons was, but he used to go to JPL Laboratory often.

Interestingly enough, at the end of American Cosmic, after traveling to the Vatican with Dr. Pisolka, Tyler converts to Roman Catholicism and then becomes convinced that the intelligences that he's been in contact with are angels rather than extraterrestrials. And Tyler has been involved with those who are currently pushing for UFO disclosure in the media, in academia, and in the government.

Indeed, it appears that the ghost of not only Jack Parsons, but also John Dee seems to be haunting segments of America's intelligence community and space program and the modern push for UFO disclosure.

And the concept of higher entities seeking to influence humanity through the occult and through the so-called progress of civilization is not a foreign concept to the Bible. In Ephesians 2, 2, Paul refers to Satan as, the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience.

So also in 2 Corinthians 4, 4, Paul refers to Satan as the god of this world who has blinded the minds of those who don't believe. And likewise, later in chapter 11 in verse 14, he says that Satan can even transform himself into an angel of light in order to deceive men and to lead them from the truth and in order to communicate a false gospel.

And when we look across history, we see this principle at work, whether it was through the prophet Muhammad, John Dee, Emmanuel Swedenborg, or Joseph Smith, we see that Satan often does present himself as an angel of light in order to lead men astray and in order to inspire false religion.

And while there have always been mystery religions and secret orders that openly seek out contact with spiritual entities and who pass along methods for contact with themselves to their initiates, like the order of the golden dawn or the church of the Lima, as Paul says there in Ephesians 2, in our fallen state, we all can become fair game for the prince of the power of the air, of course, all under God's sovereign plan.

This is important to emphasize because very often when Christians become exposed to this sort of information, they assume that it must all be due to some overarching Illuminati type conspiracy, secret societies in the shadows who pull the strings and manipulate the global economy and geopolitics.

However, as we will continue to see through this series, things are not quite so simple. And it often appears as if the phenomenon itself is what is orchestrating this disclosure.

But what about the intelligences behind the phenomenon transmitting scientific information to recipients and assisting them in making advances in the realms of science and technology? Well, once again, if you examine the history of the church, you will see that this is not a foreign concept to Christian and Jewish angelology and demonology.

In fact, if you examine ancient pagan religions, you will see that there were gods and goddesses of war and agriculture amongst other things who supposedly assisted the progress of civilization. And so because of this, many of the intertestamental Jewish theologians saw this as the work of fallen angels, especially when they taught human women how to seduce men, or when they taught men how to make deadlier weapons, or when they taught them how to engage in occult practices like sorcery and astrology.

And church fathers like Irenaeus and Tertullian would pick up this Jewish demonology and essentially affirm the same thing. So it's fair to assume that if many of the church fathers were exposed to what was just recounted in this podcast, that they would clearly see the work of the same fallen angels at play in our high-tech futuristic society, though it can often be hard for us to believe with our materialistic presuppositions about the nature of the universe that such a thing could be possible.

However, it would not just be members of the space program and intelligence communities who became intentional and unintentional initiates into occult practices and who would experience the phenomenon. As Parsons' disciples observed, something seemed to pierce the veil in 1947 that would forever haunt and inspire the popular imagination while shifting public consciousness on fundamental worldview issues. This would then lead the government to engage in a perception management campaign to keep this phenomenon and the effects of this phenomenon under wraps.

So that is what we will examine in episode four, the summer of 1947, Saucer, Fever, and the Cover-Up.
